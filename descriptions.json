   "name": "Neukölln",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Schillerkiez, Karl-Marx-Straße, Maybachufer. The area of the locality of Neukölln has a long history, beginning with a medieval village in the area which is now Richardplatz. In 1737, Frederick William I of Prussia allowed 250 Moravian Protestants to settle nearby, and this village became known as Böhmisch-Rixdorf. During the 19th century, the area, like much of Berlin, was developed to house the thousands of peasants moving to the city during the industrial revolution. It was around this time, in 1874, that the two villages were joined and later became the independent city of Rixdorf. In 1912, local officials attempted to clean up the image of the city which had become known for its nightlife by renaming it Neukölln. The name Neukölln came from the medieval village of Cölln, which was one of the two villages that later developed into the city centre of Berlin. Neukölln was incorporated into Berlin in 1920, and after World War II, the area became a part of the American sector of West Berlin. Throughout Neukölln’s history, it has had a reputation as a working class district. This has started to change with gentrification which has led to clashes between new and long-term residents. Neukölln is also known for its ethnic diversity, with large Turkish, Kurdish, Arab, and Russian populations. It was a long-time favorite for immigrants due to its inexpensive rents (which was directly related to its location near the Berlin Wall) and today the local population is 15% Turkish and 10% Arab in origin. A highlight of the area is the popular Turkish weekly market at Maybachufer which shows off the area’s multiculturalism. Neukölln still has a reputation as one of the more edgy parts of the city but this is quickly changing as rental prices increase. That being said, it remains one of the more affordable areas of the inner-city. Despite its reputation, Neukölln has much to offer: Schillerkiez has long been known for its great cafes, Karl-Marx-Straße for its restaurants, and Weserstraße for its bars and nightlife. Neukölln is an inner-city locality (Ortsteil) of Berlin in the homonymous borough (Bezirk) of Neukölln, including the historic village of Rixdorf and numerous Gründerzeit apartment blocks. The Ortsteil is densely settled with a population of 154,127 inhabitants (2009) and is the most populated one of Berlin. It was characterized by a relatively high percentage of immigrants, especially of Turkish and Russian descent. Since the turn of the millenium an influx of students, creatives and western immigrants has led to gentrification. The locality is situated in the north of the Neukölln borough, adjacent to Kreuzberg (in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg) at the Landwehrkanal. It also borders with Alt-Treptow, Plänterwald and Baumschulenweg (all part of Treptow-Köpenick) in the east and Tempelhof (in Tempelhof-Schöneberg) in the west, separated by the vast field of the former Tempelhof Airport. In the south, the Stadtring motorway forms the border with the Britz locality. The Sonnenallee, connecting Neukölln at Hermannplatz with Baumschulenweg in former East Berlin was the site of a border crossing of the Berlin Wall, perpetuated by the 1999 Sonnenallee comedy film.Neukölln counts 3 zones (Ortslagen): Böhmisch-Rixdorf, Köllnische Heide, Rixdorf. When first mentioned in 1360 the village south-east of Berlin, around the present-day Richardplatz, was called Richardsdorf and owned by the Order of St. John, hence the coat of arms of the current city borough bears the Maltese cross. It may have been the site of a former stronghold erected by the dissolved Knights Templar at neighbouring Tempelhof. In 1737, King Frederick William I of Prussia allowed about 350 Moravian Protestants expelled from Bohemia to settle in the area, then called Rixdorf. They built their own church and houses off the village centre along the road to Berlin, today called Richardstraße. This new Bohemian village (Böhmisch Rixdorf) was granted its own constitution in 1797. In the course of industrialization in the 19th century a network of new streets was laid out in the Hobrecht-Plan in an area that came to be known architecturally as the Wilhelmine Ring. In 1863 a Turkish cemetery was laid out north of Rixdorf, the successor of a smaller burial ground in Kreuzberg established in 1798 for the Turkish members of the Prussian Army. It contains the mortal remains of the Ottoman ambassador Giritli Ali Aziz Efendi, the exiled Grand Vizier Mehmed Talat and Bahattin Şakir. When both parts of the village were reunited in 1874, the place had 8,000 inhabitants, growing to 15,000 the next year. On May 1, 1899 Rixdorf, then the largest village of Prussia, received the status of an independent city and had become notorious for its taverns and amusement sites. In 1912, the local authorities tried to get rid of this reputation by assuming the current name derived from the Old Cölln part of medieval Berlin - an attempt that ultimately failed. Nevertheless, it was during this time, when the architect Reinhold Kiehl was called on by the local council to upgrade the city's infrastructure. This has led to some of the areas most iconic buildings being erected, such as the Rathaus Neukölln ('City Hall') or the Stadtbad Neukölln ('Public Bath').[1] Neukölln's independence ended in 1920 when it was incorporated into Greater Berlin. From 1945 to 1990, it was part of the American sector of West Berlin. A trend is the rapid gentrification of certain neighborhoods within Neukölln. There has been an influx of students, creatives and other young professionals of mostly Western origin avoiding higher rents charged in other parts of Berlin. This has caused a knock on effect of rents to rise in some parts of Neukölln.[2] Northern Neukölln, just to the south of the Kreuzberg area has become informally referred to as Kreuzkölln as the area becomes increasingly fashionable.Rixdorf village church, consecrated in 1481, adopted by the Moravian Protestants in 1737, officially called Bethlehem Church since 1912. Şehitlik Mosque, on the Turkish cemetery, finished in 2005 by the Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs (DİTİB) Neuköllner Oper: Opera house where you can see from musicals to baroque opera or operetta, experimental music theatre... Famous for its aim to bring elitist culture to a wider audience."

   "name": "Britz",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Britzer Garten, Schloss Britz, Dorfkirche Britz. Originally a farmstead, Britz (the name of which originates from the Slavic word for the birch tree), remains a locality primarily made up of small garden allotments. The northern part of the locality was originally settled by Bohemian craftsmen, and it remains one of the more thickly settled areas. Of particular note is the Britzer Garten which covers 90 hectares of land and was initially designed for the 1985 Federal Garden Show (Bundesgartenschau). Britz remains a quiet neighborhood and the more densely settled north and eastern parts of the locality are readily accessible by the U-Bahn U7. Alt-Britz retains a village feel with a small church (Dorfkirche Britz), a farmstead, and manor house (Schloss Britz). The area has become popular with families and the Horseshoe Estate (Hufeisensiedlung) designed by architect Bruno Taut is a popular place to live and is now a UNESCO World Heritage site. The village of Britzig was first mentioned in 1273. It was incorporated by the 1920 Greater Berlin Act. It is known for being the site of the Hufeisensiedlung (Horseshoe Estate), part of the UNESCO Berlin Modernism Housing Estates World Heritage Site since 2008. The subsidized housing estate was built on the fields of Britz manor between 1925 and 1933 according to plans by Bruno Taut and Martin Wagner. The project was initiated by a housing cooperative established to combat the shortage of affordable living space. Numerous blocks and terraced houses in New Objectivity style with colorful facades include more than 1,000 apartments, situated in spacious gardens designed by landscape architect Leberecht Migge.The transmission facility of the newly founded RIAS - present-day Deutschlandradio - was built on a site in Britz in 1946 by the American military administration. Several temporary structures were replaced in 1948 with the current, 100-metre high steel masts. These were later extended to heights of 160 m and 144 m. Short-wave transmissions were made from Britz starting in 1949. In 1978 a medium-wave transmission aerial was added to allow better reception across the whole of the GDR's territory, especially at night. The disused Blub (Berliner Luft- und Badeparadies) water park is situated in Britz, near the Teltow Canal. It has become a site of interest to those interested in ruined architecture. It is due for redevelopment in the near future."

   "name": "Buckow",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Dorfkirche Alt-Buckow. The village of Buckow was founded in 1373 by German settlers, although the name comes from the Slavic word for a Beech tree. Until 1920, it was a part of the municipality of Teltow in Brandenburg, but thereafter became a part of the city of Berlin. It is the only locality of Berlin to be divided in two, with Gropiusstadt separating it into Buckow I and Buckow II. Much of the area retains a rural flair, though it becomes more metropolitan near Johannisthaler Chaussee. It is an area largely consisting of single-family homes, although there is the occasional apartment block. Buckow is a very quiet and is not particularly easy to access with public transport. The nearest U-Bahn stations are in Johannisthaler Chaussee and Lipschitzallee, both of which are located in Gropiusstadt nearby. It has a more rural feel than other areas of the city, but its remoteness might make it an unpopular choice for those seeking the famous nightlife of Berlin.  The village was founded in 1373 by German settlers probably at the place of an earlier Wends' village of the name Buk (a Beech tree) spelled along with its patronymic suffix -ow. Until 1920 Buckow was a municipality of the former Teltow district, merged into Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act.[1] From 1961 to 1989 its borders with Brandenburg were crossed by the Berlin Wall due to its position in the boundaries of West Berlin with East Germany. In Goldammerstraße 34 is situated an historical smock mill, the Jungfernmühle,[2] one of the oldest of Berlin. It was built in 1753 (or 1757) and it has only shutter wing and wind rose mockups without functions. Active until 1980 to ground grain into flour, it was the last mill used in the city and today its walls accommodate a restaurant. Situated in the southern suburb of Berlin, Buckow is the only Ortsteil counting an exclave (Buckow-II), separated from mainland by the Gropiusstadt. The other Berliner localities bordering with Buckow are Britz, Rudow, Lichtenrade and Mariendorf (both in Tempelhof-Schöneberg district). Buckow also has a boundary with the Brandenburger municipality of Schönefeld (Dahme-Spreewald district), and its residential area is contiguous with the civil parish of Großziethen."

   "name": "Rudow",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Dörferblick, Rudower Fließ.Rudow’s history as a farmstead, like much of the outlying areas of Berlin, began in the 1200’s. However, there is archaeological evidence to suggest the area has been continuously settled for much longer, likely by Slavic settlers who named it Rudow from the older Slavic word for red earth or iron ore. It soon developed into a small village and the surrounding area became a popular hunting location for the sons of the Friedrich Wilhelm von Brandenburg. During the division of Berlin, Rudow was formerly an isolated village without easy public transport options and bordering the GDR state of Brandenburg. Since the development of Gropiusstadt there is now a U-Bahn connection and its closeness to the Berlin Schönefeld Airport and the motorway has stimulated growth. The locality is primarily comprised of single-family homes, apartment blocks, greenery, and farms. Popular outdoor activities are often based around the Dörferblick, a hill built from rubble which allows for nice views of the area, and the local river the Rudower Fließ. It is a quiet locality mostly consisting of older residents and families. It should be noted that while Rudow is a generally safe district to live, there have been reported cases of far right activity in the area.  The village was founded in 1373. Until 1920 it was a municipality of the former Teltow district, merged into Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act. Due to its position at the borders of West Berlin with East Berlin and Brandenburg, 3/4 of its boundaries were crossed by the Berlin Wall from 1961 to 1989. Rudow is located in the southern suburb of Berlin, at the boundary with the Brandenburger municipality of Schönefeld, in the district of Dahme-Spreewald. It borders with the Berliner localities of Buckow, Gropiusstadt, Britz, Johannisthal and Altglienicke (both in Treptow-Köpenick district). The Teltowkanal represents the border with Johannisthal."

   "name": "Gropiusstadt",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Jungfernmühle, Trinity Church (Dreieinigkeitskirche). Gropiusstadt is one of the newest developed areas of Berlin. Named for one of the founders of the Bauhaus movement, Martin Gropius, it was originally intended to be a housing estate of small buildings with lots of green space. However, with the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, these plans were forced to change and instead large high-rises were built. Despite the initial good intentions of the designers the compacted conditions and general remoteness led to the area becoming a problem-area for crime and poverty. This was famously extolled in the book Wir Kinder von Bahnhof Zoo by Christiane F. which was also made into a film.  Recently, the area has seen an increase in far-right activity. It continues to have a reputation as an undesirable area of the city with high unemployment, cultural clashes and other socio-economic issues. However, it is also a quiet area with lots of green space and some of the lowest rents in the city. Building of the quarter, initially named Britz-Buckow-Rudow and projected in a modernist style by Walter Gropius,[1] ended in 1960. In Berlin, Gropius also projected the Sommerfeld House, the Interbau and the Großsiedlung Siemensstadt quarter. As part of West Berlin, its borders with Brandenburg (part of East Germany) were crossed by the Berlin Wall from 1961 to 1989. As of 2001 it was still an autonomous Ortsteil. It became famous as the place in which the German writer Christiane F. lived from childhood to adolescence,[3] author of the novel Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo. Gropiusstadt is located in the eastern suburb of Berlin and a small part of it (the easternmost one) borders with Schönefeld, a municipality in Dahme-Spreewald district, Brandenburg. It borders with the Berlin localities of Britz, Rudow and Buckow. This locality also separates Buckow from its northern exclave, a zone named Buckow-II."

   "name": "Charlottenburg",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Kurfürstendamm, Savigny Platz, Charlottenburg Palace. Initially a small village called Lietzow, the area of Charlottenburg has been continuously occupied since the early 1200’s. It received its current name after Sophia Charlotte of Hannover, the wife of Frederick I, King of Prussia. Frederick I built a palace in the area near Lietzow for Sophia Charlotte, and after she passed away both the palace and village came to be known as Charlottenburg. Over the years, the palace’s popularity waxed and waned before eventually becoming a favorite royal residence into the 19th century. In addition to developments from the crown, the surrounding area of the district became popular as a recreational area for the city, and there were many beer gardens and inns. In the late 19th century, Charlottenburg became a residential area for the Bourgeoisie, and was developed to have wide streets, spacious buildings, and plenty of parks.  In the 1920’s, it became a centre of nightlife in Berlin and a popular residence for artists. The area was heavily damaged during the Second World War, but after Berlin was partitioned, it quickly became established as the centre of West Berlin. Despite its vast commercial development during the Cold War, after the reunification it struggled to find its place within the city, although Kurfürstendamm remains the main shopping street. As rental prices rise in the popular former East, Charlottenburg is often a more affordable option within the centre districts of Berlin. The locality is urban and the majority of buildings are tenement houses from the late 19th and early 20th centuries or newer buildings built after World War II. There are long-standing Russian and Turkish communities in the locality, and Kantstraße is known as the Chinatown of Berlin. Savignyplatz is a highlight of old buildings, tree-lined streets, and classy cafes. And to this day, Charlottenburg remains a popular location for famous artists and performers. Charlottenburg is an affluent locality of Berlin within the borough of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf. Established as a town in 1705 and named after late Sophia Charlotte of Hanover, Queen consort of Prussia, it is best known for Charlottenburg Palace, the largest surviving royal palace in Berlin, and the adjacent museums. Charlottenburg was an independent city to the west of Berlin until 1920 when it was incorporated into Groß-Berlin (Greater Berlin) and transformed into a borough. In the course of Berlin's 2001 administrative reform it was merged with the former borough of Wilmersdorf becoming a part of a new borough called Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf. Later, in 2004, the new borough's districts were rearranged, dividing the former borough of Charlottenburg into the localities of Charlottenburg proper, Westend and Charlottenburg-Nord. Charlottenburg is located in Berlin's inner city, west of the Großer Tiergarten park. Its historic core, the former village green of Alt Lietzow, is situated on the southern shore of the Spree River running through the Berlin glacial valley. The Straße des 17. Juni road, former Charlottenburger Chaussee, which runs eastwards from Charlottenburg Gate through the Tiergarten park to Brandenburg Gate, connects Charlottenburg with the historic centre of Berlin-Mitte. n the north and west, the Berlin Ringbahn and the Bundesautobahn 100 (Stadtring) mark the border with the Charlottenburg-Nord and Westend suburbs. Adjacent in the south is the territory of Wilmersdorf. Charlottenburg also borders on the district of Halensee in the southwest, as well as on Moabit, Hansaviertel and Tiergarten (all part of the Mitte borough) in the east and on Schöneberg in the southeast. Archaeological findings in the area date back to the Neolithic era. Within the Margraviate of Brandenburg, on the land occupied by present-day Charlottenburg, there were three settlements in the late Middle Ages: the farmsteads Lietzow (pronounced leat-tsow) south of the Spree and Casow (pr. caasow) beyond the river, as well as a further settlement called Glienicke (pr. gleanicke). Although these names are of Slavic origin, the settlements are likely to have had a mixed Slavic and German population. Lietzow (also called Lietze, Lutze, Lutzen, Lütze, Lützow, Lusze and Lucene) was first documented in 1239, when the Ascanian margraves John I and Otto III of Brandenburg founded the Benedictine Sankt Marien nunnery in nearby Spandau. The nuns were enfeoffed with the Lucene and Casow estates, while the Lietzow farmstead probably was expanded to a village by 1315, Casow was already mentioned as abandoned in the 1375 doomsday book of Emperor Charles IV.[1] From old field names, it is believed that a third medieval settlement on Charlottenburg territory, Glienicke, arose in the area of the present day streets Kantstraße, Fasanenstraße, Kurfürstendamm and Uhlandstraße at the former Gliniker Lake. Unlike Casow and Glienicke, the Lietzow area has been populated continuously and its development is well documented. In the course of the Protestant Reformation, Elector Joachim II Hector of Brandenburg confiscated the monastic estates in 1542 and finally had the nunnery dissolved in 1558. For more than four hundred years, members of the Berendt family were mayors and thus had to pay lower taxes. A village church was first documented in 1541. Ecclesiastically, Lietzow came under the Wilmersdorf parish, the priests reached it from there by the so-called Priesterweg (priest's way), on the line of the streets now called Leibnizstraße, Konstanzer Straße and Brandenburgische Straße. In 1695, Sophia Charlotte of Hanover received Lietzow from her husband, Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg, in exchange for her estates in Caputh and Langerwisch near Potsdam. Frederick had a summer residence built there for Sophie Charlotte by the architect Johann Arnold Nering between 1695 and 1699. After he had crowned himself Frederick I, King in Prussia, the Lützenburg castle was extended into a stately building with a cour d'honneur. The Swedish master builder Johann Friedrich Eosander supervised this work. Sophie Charlotte died in February 1705, shortly afterwards the settlement facing the palace was called Charlottenburg - the palace itself became Schloss Charlottenburg - and chartered as a town on April 5, 1705. The king served as the town's mayor until the historic village of Lietzow was incorporated into Charlottenburg in 1720. Frederick's successor as king, Frederick William I of Prussia, rarely stayed at the palace, which depressed the small town of Charlottenburg. Frederick William even tried to revoke the town's privileges. With the coronation of his successor Frederick II inl 1740 the town's significance increased, as regular celebrations again took place at the palace. Between 1740 and 1747 Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff built the eastern New Wing as Frederick's residence. Later, Frederick II preferred the palace of Sanssouci, which he had partly designed himself. When Frederick II died in 1786, his nephew Frederick William II succeeded him, and Charlottenburg became the favourite royal residence, and remained so for his son and successor Frederick William III (reigned 1797-1840). After the defeat of the Prussian army at Jena in 1806, the French occupied Berlin. Napoleon took over the palace, while his troops made a camp nearby. Charlottenburg became part of the new Prussian Province of Brandenburg in 1815 after the Napoleonic Wars. In the late 18th century, Charlottenburg's development did not depend only on the crown. The town became a recreational area for the expanding city of Berlin. Its first true inn opened in the 1770s, in the street then called Berliner Straße (now Otto-Suhr-Allee), and many other inns and beer gardens were to follow, popular for weekend parties especially. Berliners seeking leisure and entertainment came by boat, by carriage and later by horse-drawn trams, above all to a large amusement park at the shore of the Spree river called Flora, that went into bankruptcy in 1904. From the 1860s on the wealthy Bourgeoisie of Berlin discovered Charlottenburg as a residential area, among the first were Gerson von Bleichröder and Ernst Werner von Siemens, who had a villa built in the Berliner Straße in 1862. At the same time industrial companies like Siemens & Halske and Schering erected large factories in the north-east, at the border with the Moabit district of Berlin. In 1877 Charlottenburg received town privileges and until World War I saw an enormous increase of population with 100,000 inhabitants as of 1893 and a population of 306,000 in 1920, being the second largest city within the Province of Brandenburg, after Berlin. In the course of industrialization in the 19th century, much of Charlottenburg was incorporated in a network of streets laid out in the Hobrecht-Plan in an area that came to be known architecturally as the Wilhelmine Ring. The development was accompanied by an urban planning of broad streets and sidewalks, parks and spacious residential buildings, especially around the southern Kurfürstendamm area, which enabled large parts of Charlottenburg to preserve their affluent residential character. The richest town of Prussia established a Royal Technical College in 1879 (which later became the Berlin Institute of Technology), followed by the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt and the College of the Fine Arts. A new town hall with a 88 m (289 ft) tall spire was erected on the occasion of its 200-year jubilee in 1905 and an opera house opened in 1912. The history of Charlottenburg as a municipality in its own right ended with the Greater Berlin Act of October 1, 1920, when the town became a part of Berlin. The Province of Brandenburg was administered in Charlottenburg from 1918 until the province's dissolution in 1946 after World War II. In the 1920s the area around the Kurfürstendamm evolved into the New West of Berlin, a development that had already started around 1900 with the opening of the Theater des Westens, the Café des Westens and the Kaufhaus des Westens, followed by several theatres, cinemas, bars and restaurants, which made Charlottenburg the Berlin centre of leisure and nightlife. Artists like Alfred Döblin, Otto Dix, Gottfried Benn, Else Lasker-Schüler, Bertolt Brecht, Max Liebermann, Stefan Zweig and Friedrich Hollaender socialized in the legendary Romanisches Café at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. However the days of the Golden Twenties came to an end with the rise of the Nazi Party. In World War II the area around the Breitscheidplatz was heavily damaged by air raids and the Battle of Berlin.[citation needed] Nevertheless, after 1945 the Kurfürstendamm area quickly regained its importance, as with the partition of the city in the Cold War it became the commercial centre of West-Berlin. It was therefore the site of protests and major demonstrations of the late 1960s German student movement, that culminated on June 2, 1967 when student Benno Ohnesorg was shot by a police officer during a demonstration against Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi at the Deutsche Oper.[citation needed] Before the reunification of Berlin, Charlottenburg was the center of West Berlin, with many high market bars and restaurants. After 1990 German reunification Charlottenburg struggled with the rise of the Mitte borough as Berlin's historic centre.[2] The City West is still the main shopping area, offering several major hotels, theatres, bars and restaurants. The area around Charlottenburg's Kantstrasse is Berlin's Chinatown in the West, with a high concentration of Asian shops, gastronomy and inhabitants. It is commonly dubbed Kantonstrasse, in reference to the southern Chinese province of Guangdong.[3] Sights Town hall, about 1905 Theater des Westens Museum Berggruen Royal Mausoleum  Beside the palace, Charlottenburg is also home to: the old and new Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church on the Breitscheidplatz, built in 1895 by Franz Schwechten and in 1961 by Egon Eiermann, the former West Berlin landmark the Europa-Center, Berlin's first shopping mall opened in 1965 Bahnhof Zoo, the main railway station in Berlin until the opening of Berlin Hauptbahnhof in 2006 the adjacent Berlin Zoological Garden, opened in 1844, officially located on the territory of the neighbouring Tiergarten locality Kurfürstendamm avenue, first laid out about 1542, today together with the Tauentzienstraße Berlin's main shopping area Technical University of Berlin with about 27,000 students, founded in 1879 Berlin University of the Arts with about 4,500 students Charlottenburg Town Hall, built in 1905 Charlottenburg Gate Luisenkirche on Gierkeplatz, built in 1823 by Karl Friedrich Schinkel the Amerika Haus on Hardenbergstraße, built in 1957 by the United States Information Agency the Malteser-Hilfsdienst (Order of Malta) building at Alt-Lietzow str. 33 the Literaturhaus on Fasanenstraße and the nearby Institute for Media and Communication Policy Theatres Deutsche Oper Berlin on Bismarckstraße, opened in 1912, one of the three Berlin opera houses with relief in memory of Benno Ohnesorg by Alfred Hrdlicka, 1971 (installed in 1990) Theater des Westens musical theatre at Kantstraße, built in 1896 Renaissance-Theater on Hardenbergstraße, 1902, rebuilt in Art deco design by Oskar Kaufmann in 1927 Schiller Theater, built by Max Littmann in 1906 Theater am Kurfürstendamm, 1921 Museums Museum Berggruen for classic modern art Museum Scharf-Gerstenberg for surrealist art both located in the former Gardes du Corps barracks at Charlottenburg Palace, built by Friedrich August Stüler 1859  Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte (Museum for Pre- and Early History) Museum of Photography and Helmut Newton Foundation, next to Bahnhof Zoo Bröhan Museum for Art Nouveau and Art Deco Literaturhaus Berlin and Käthe Kollwitz Museum on Fasanenstraße Gipsformerei (Replica workshop) of the Berlin State Museums Beate Uhse Erotic Museum (Closed in September 2014 and searching for new premises.[4])"

   "name": "Charlottenburg-Nord",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Jungfernheide Park, the Plötzensee Memorial (Die Gedenkstätte Plötzensee), Maria Regina Martyrum. Before district restructuring in 2004, the locality of Charlottenburg-Nord was a part of Charlottenburg proper. With the restructuring, the zones of Siedlung Charlottenburg-Nord, Jungfernheide, Paul-Hertz-Siedlung, Plötzensee, and Großsiedlung Siemensstadt were combined to form the new locality. The majority of this area was only settled after the Second World War. Prior to this time the only settlements were the Siemens factory and a prison built in the 1870’s in Plötzensee. The Plötzensee Prison was the location of the executions of hundreds of anti-Nazi resistance fighters. There is now a memorial to those executed by the Nazis at the prison. Today, the area remains a working class district with limited options for nightlife or entertainment. The northern third of the district is comprised of the park Jungfernheide, the eastern third are private garden allotments (Kleingartenanlage), and in the south-west are housing estates. Charlottenburg-Nord remains one of the cheaper areas of Berlin and is a good choice for those searching for cheaper options within quick transit to Charlottenburg. Charlottenburg-Nord is a locality (Ortsteil) in the northern part of the Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf borough of Berlin, Germany. It is chielfy composed of after-war housing estates, allotment gardens and commercial zones. The locality comprises the Großsiedlung Siemensstadt, part of the Berlin Modernism Housing Estates UNESCO World Heritage Site, as well as Plötzensee Prison. Charlottenburg-Nord is situated in the western suburbs of Berlin, beyond the Ringbahn line of the Berlin S-Bahn. In the north the Berlin-Spandau Ship Canal forms the border with Reinickendorf and Tegel, a bridge leading right to the southern entrance of Berlin Tegel Airport. It further borders with Siemensstadt (part of the Spandau borough) in the west. In the east and south the Berlin-Spandau Ship Canal and the Westhafen Canal mark the border with the inner city localities of Wedding and Moabit (both part of the Mitte borough) and Charlottenburg. The locality is subdivided in several zones (Ortslagen) like the Großsiedlung Siemensstadt and Siedlung Charlottenburg-Nord housing estates in the west, the Jungfernheide municipal park as well as the Paul-Hertz-Siedlung and Plötzensee in the east with the Roman Catholic commemorative church Maria Regina Martyrum, honouring the Martyrs of Freedom of Belief and Conscience that were executed at Plötzensee Prison during the Nazi era in the years from 1933 to 1945. Together with the nearby Protestant Church of Plötzensee, it is the site of the annual Ecumenical Plötzensee Days. The locality was created in 2004, when it was separated from Charlottenburg in the south. Since the 1920 Greater Berlin Act, the area had been part of the Charlottenburg borough (Bezirk Charlottenburg), united with Wilmersdorf in the 2001 administrative reform."

   "name": "Wilmersdorf",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Volkspark Wilmersdorf, Preussen Park Thai Market. Wilmersdorf has a long history in the area, likely beginning in 1220 during the German Eastern Expansion (Ostsiedlung) of the Margraves of Brandenburg. A successful farming community, Wilmersdorf began to rapidly expand in the 18th century, and by the 19th century land speculation along with influx of millions of economic migrants led to the area becoming an urban environment. It joined the city of Berlin in 1920 during the Greater Berlin Act and during this time developed into a middle-class community. In the early 20th century, the district had a large percentage of Jewish residents, comprising of more than 13% of the population in 1933. During the Nazi era, the Jewish population of Wilmersdorf was systematically displaced and exterminated. Despite this tragic past, Wilmersdorf continues to be a stronghold of the community, and includes the Israeli embassy. The modern locality of Wilmersdorf is an eclectic mix of the fast-pace of inner-city living and calm, quiet residential areas. To its north, it borders the shop street of Kurfürstendamm with its many restaurants and high-street shops. The south of the locality is far more residential with quiet streets, parks, and cafes being the norm. It is one of the more expensive places to rent in Berlin. The village near Berlin was first mentioned in 1293 as Wilmerstorff, probably founded in the course of the German Ostsiedlung under the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg. From the 1850s on Deutsch-Wilmersdorf was developed as a densely settled, affluent residential area, which in 1920 became a part of Greater Berlin. The former borough of Wilmersdorf included the localities of Halensee, Schmargendorf and Grunewald. During the era of the Weimar Republic Wilmersdorf was a popular residential area for artists and intellectuals. In 1923 the foundation stone for the first mosque in Germany was laid on the initiative of some islamic students in Wilmersdorf. It was completed in 1925. The so called Wilmersdorfer Moschee (Mosque of Wilmersdorf) is still owned and maintained by the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement. In 1933, the year in which Hitler came to power, 13.5% of the population was Jewish, many of them were deported by the Nazis from Berlin-Grunewald Station. Deutsche Bahn established a memorial on 27 January 1998 at the historic track 17 (Gleis 17), where most of the deportation trains departed. The synagogue of Wilmersdorf in the Prinzregentenstraße was destroyed by the Nazis in the Reichsprogromnacht on 9–10 November 1938. A memorial plaque commemorates the former synagogue. A new synagogue and community centre was established 2007 in the Münstersche Straße for the growing Jewish community in Wilmersdorf.

   "name": "Halensee",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Hochmeisterkirche, Kurfürstendamm. Like the district of Charlottenburg-Nord, Halensee only recently became its own locality with district restructuring in 2004. Prior to 2004, Halensee was a part of the locality of Wilmersdorf. It was named after a lake in the Grunewald and was developed as tenement housing in the late 19th century. It was an area popular with retired military officers and writers. In the 1920’s it was also a popular location for Russian immigrants. During the Second World War, Halensee was severely damaged and so the area is a mix of new modern buildings and older tenement houses.With Kurfürstendamm running through its centre, Halensee has a lot to offer in terms of shops and restaurants despite its small size. It is an easy walking distance from many of the main sights in Charlottenburg. The area is primarily urban with a mix of new and old apartment blocks. The rent prices are similar to those in Charlottenburg, and it is easy to get from Halensee to most central areas of the city making it a popular choice. Halensee was the site of the German shooting championship in 1921. On 26 September, one Jannich won the competition firing an Ortgies semi-automatic pistol. The locality, the smallest of the Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district, is situated in its centre and borders with Charlottenburg, Wilmersdorf, Schmargendorf, Grunewald and Westend. It is bounded by the Bundesautobahn 100 (Stadtring) in the west and the Cicerostraße, a branch-off of the Kurfürstendamm in the east. The locality is named after the small Halensee lake (de), which however is part of the neighbouring Grunewald locality."

   "name": "Schmargendorf",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Breite Straße, Berkaer Straße, Rathaus Schargendorf. Another small village which joined the city of Berlin during the Greater Berlin Act of 1920, Schmargendorf, like the neighboring village of Wilmersdorf, was likely founded in 1220. It was first mentioned in 1354 and at the time it was called ’s Margreven Dorp which translates as the Margrave’s village, and over time it reached its current spelling. Schmargendorf borders the Grunewald forest, which led to it becoming a popular residential area of the middle class. Today, Schmargendorf remains largely residential with a small-town feel, limited public transportation, and relatively high rents. While much of the area is comprised of villas, there are also some apartment blocks. The east of the locality contains a large sport complex and to the south is an area of private garden allotments (Kleingartenanlage). Schmargendorf borders with the localities of Grunewald (with Grunewald Forest) in the west, Halensee in the north, Wilmersdorf in the north and east, as well as Dahlem (this one in Steglitz-Zehlendorf borough) in the south. The northeastern border with Berlin's inner city is marked by the Ringbahn line of the Berlin S-Bahn and the Stadtring motorway. The village in the Margraviate of Brandenburg was first mentioned as des or ’s Margreven Dorp (literally English: the Margrave's Village) in 1354, contracted to Low German Smargendorp and later adapted to High German standard as Schmargendorf.[1] It was probably established about 1220 by German settlers in the course of the Ostsiedlung under the co-ruling Ascanian Margraves John I and Otto III of Brandenburg, after the former Slavic territories had been conquered by their great-grandfather Albert the Bear. During the growth of the City of Berlin after the 1871 unification of Germany, many peasants profited by the real estate speculation, when Schmargendorf on the eastern rim of the Grunewald forest became a popular residential area. In 1899 the former village was separated from neighbouring Wilmersdorf and received municipal rights within the Brandenburgian Landkreis Teltow, whereafter the residents had the lavish Neo-Gothic town hall erected in 1902. On 1 October 1920 Schmargendorf was incorporated into Berlin by the Greater Berlin Act. Since 1954 Schmargendorf houses the Berlinisches Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster, formerly located in Berlin Mitte."

   "name": "Grunewald",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Holocaust Memorial Track 17, Grunewald Park. Grunewald (English: Green Forest) derives its name from the neighboring hunting lodge of the same name which is the oldest preserved castle in Berlin. It was developed in the late 19th century as an upper-class residential area, largely promoted by the chancellor Otto von Bismarck. It soon became one of the wealthiest areas of Berlin. Along with its impressive villas and natural beauty, Grunewald is also well known for its dark past of being the location of the Grunewald freight railway station where more than 50,000 Jews were deported by the Nazis to extermination camps. Not much has changed in Grunewald over the years, and it remains mostly made up of the forest and a limited area of villas. It is a popular location for walking, cycling, and swimming with more than 3,000 hectares of land. Only the eastern part of the locality is populated, and it is a quiet and expensive residential suburb of the city. The locality is situated in the western side of the city and is separated from Spandau by the river Havel. It borders with the localities of Westend, Halensee, Schmargendorf, Wilhelmstadt, Gatow (both in Spandau district), Nikolassee, Zehlendorf and Dahlem (all three in Steglitz-Zehlendorf district). The Grunewald forest is 10 km away from Berlin-Mitte (Germany's capital). The name derives from the Grunewald hunting lodge of 1543, the oldest preserved castle in Berlin, which is, however, officially located on the grounds of the adjacent Dahlem locality. It was erected in an Early Renaissance style by order of Elector Joachim II Hector of Brandenburg and named Zum Gruenen Wald, the umlaut spelt with a following <e> instead of a diacritic as depicted above the main entrance. A corduroy road leading from the Berlin Stadtschloss to the lodge was laid out, which later would be known as the Kurfürstendamm boulevard. The neighbourhood developed out of a so-called mansion colony at the western end of the Kurfürstendamm. Promoted by Otto von Bismarck the upper class of Berlin from 1880 on discovered Grunewald as an attractive site for living, which was incorporated into Greater Berlin in 1920. Today, the social structure of Grunewald is still influenced by these origins. The Rot-Weiss Tennis Club, home of the WTA Tour German Open, has been located in the district since 1897. On June 24, 1922 Foreign Minister of Germany Walther Rathenau was assassinated by ultra-nationalist radicals of the Organisation Consul in a curve of the main street called Koenigsallee. A memorial stone marks the scene of the crime. Since 1981 the Grunewald district is the home of the Institute for Advanced Study, Berlin. It also houses the embassies of Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Qatar, Kuwait, Laos, Luxembourg, the Republic of Macedonia, Poland, Serbia and Turkey. Within the Grunewald forest is the artificial Teufelsberg hill, once a listening station of the US National Security Agency. At the shore of the Havel the Grunewaldturm, built by Franz Heinrich Schwechten in 1898, offers panoramic views of the Havelland region. Between October 1941 and February 1945 more than 50,000 Jews were deported by Nazis to extermination camps from the Grunewald freight railway station and murdered. Nowadays, memorials from the district of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf and the Deutsche Bahn (Gleis 17) commemorate this dark spot in Grunewald's history. The area is accessible by the Berlin-Grunewald station."

   "name": "Westend",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Theodor-Heuss-Platz, Olympic Stadium (Olympiastadion), Steubenplatz.For most of its history, Westend was a sandy hill with only a few mills. However, following the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt in 1806, Napoleon set up a camp for his occupying troops while he resided in the nearby Charlottenburg Palace. After the French troops withdrew, the area remained unoccupied. In the 1840’s, a brewery was opened called the Spandau Bock Beer Brewery and its popularity led to the development of several bars and inns on the road to Charlottenburg. However, it wasn’t much thought of until the 1860’s when developers began to buy up large parcels of land in the area in order to build villas for the wealthy. It was at this time that it received the name Westend, so called after the ritzy district of London. While these initial development plans collapsed in the economic Panic of 1873, the area soon became populated due to the increasing need for residential areas as Berlin expanded during the industrial revolution. During the early 20th century, the northwestern area of Westend became the home of several sports complexes culminating in the stadium for the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Westend is a mix of different types of buildings from tenement houses to villas to private garden allotments (kleingartenanlage). While quite a distance from the center of the city, the rental prices remain rather average for Berlin. In Neu-Westend (U-Bahn Neu-Westend) there are primarily tenement houses, but a few blocks away is a large villa colony built in the early 20th century. The west of the district is mostly comprised of the Olympic complex and to the north is park area and garden allotments. The south west corner near Heerstraße is more rural in nature with a small-town feel. Westend is situated west of Berlin's inner city on Spandauer Berg, the northern peak of the sandy Teltow plateau between the river valleys of Spree and Havel. It is centered on Theodor-Heuss-Platz, a large square, from where the Heerstraße arterial road, part of the Bundesstraße 2 and Bundesstraße 5 highways, runs west towards the Berlin city limits. In the west and north, Westend borders on the Berlin Spandau borough. The locality also includes the neighbourhoods of Neu-Westend and Ruhleben, a suburban housing area of the 1920s. The site of the former Ruhleben internment camp, a World War I detention camp for civilians, today is part of the adjacent Spandau district. Furthermore, the areas of Pichelsberg, Heerstraße and Eichkamp at the northern rim of the Grunewald forest belong to Westend. It is also home of the Messe Berlin exhibition grounds (where the International Green Week and the Internationale Funkausstellung are held) and of the Olympiastadion built for the 1936 Summer Olympics. When upon the 1806 Battle of Jena–Auerstedt victorious Napoleon moved into Berlin, he had a military camp set up on Spandauer Berg, though he himself chose nearby Charlottenburg Palace for accommodation. In May 1808 General Claude Victor-Perrin, French governor of Berlin, pitched the large Camp Napoleonbourg here, however, he folded up his tents already in November and wasteland was left behind. On the road from Charlottenburg to Spandau, the Spandauer Bock brewery was established in 1840, together with a popular pub catering though of doubtful reputation. The Villenkolonie Westend was developed from 1866 on as a residential area for the wealthy bourgeoisie of Berlin and named after the West End of London. The beginnings, overshadowed by the Austro-Prussian War, were quite modest and the first land settlement company around the Stettin merchant Johannes Quistorp and architect Martin Gropius collapsed in the Panic of 1873. Nevertheless, the development was boosted by Berlin's population pressure after the unification of Germany and similar to other mansion colonies such as Lichterfelde West or Grunewald, most of the premsies were overbuilt by the end of the century. The area was connected to the Berlin Ringbahn with the inauguration of Westend station in 1877. In 1889 a harness racing track opened, which was relocated to Ruhleben in 1908. Westend again became a garrison town, when in the 1890s the 3rd Brigade regiment No. 3 (Königin Elisabeth) barracks of the German 2nd Guards Infantry Division were erected on the eastern Spandauer Berg slope. On 8 June 1913, the Deutsches Stadion was inaugurated in the northern Grunewald forest, designated as venue of the 1916 Summer Olympics that were never held due to World War I and later rebuilt as Olympiastation.

   "name": "Kreuzberg",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Skalitzer Straße, Checkpoint Charlie, Victoria Park.Kreuzberg, also known as X-Berg, is an area with a rather recent history. During the 1920 Greater Berlin Act which unified the city of Berlin with outlying towns, the locality of Kreuzberg was created from several under populated areas. The largest hill in the district in Victoriapark was called Kreuzberg by King Frederick William III of Prussia after the Iron Cross at the top of the Prussian National Monument for the Liberation Wars. Subsequently the surrounding area took the name as well. During the 1860’s, Kreuzberg began to grow due to industrialization. The area came to be known as a center of industry in Berlin with many profitable small businesses along with the press quarter where many of Germany’s largest newspapers and publishers made their home. During World War II, the area was damaged by air raids, and the industrial area of Kreuzberg was largely destroyed. Following the war, Kreuzberg became part of the American sector of West Berlin, and due to its low rents was known as a prime location for artists and immigrants. With the reunification of Germany, Kreuzberg was once again a part of Berlin’s city center and the area’s cheap rents made it a popular choice for young people, artists, and immigrants. Like its neighbor Friedrichshain, it has seen much gentrification over the last decade including a steep increase in rental prices. It continues to be a popular location due to its interesting nightlife and wide range of multicultural restaurants and bars. To the North, it has more of the feel of the district of Mitte, very urban and more expensive. Several important historical sites are in this area of Kreuzberg such as the border crossing site between East and West Berlin, Checkpoint Charlie, and the museum depicting the horrors of the Nazi era, the Topography of Terror (Topographie des Terrors). The south west of Kreuzberg is more affluent and residential, and the eastern part of the district trendier with an active nightlife. In recent years, there has been an increase in crime in the areas of Kreuzberg near U-Bahn station Kottbuser Tor. Görlitzer Park, while a popular area during the day, is also an area of crime during the evenings. It is important when visiting these areas to always be aware of your surroundings and diligent with your belongings. Kreuzberg, a part of the combined Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg borough located south of Mitte since 2001, is one of the best-known areas of Berlin, Germany. Kreuzberg, colloquially also known as X-Berg (derived from the meaning of Kreuz (cross)), is often described as consisting of two distinctive parts: the SO 36, home to many immigrants, and SW 61, roughly coterminous with the old postal codes for the two areas in West Berlin.[1] Kreuzberg has emerged from its history as one of the poorest quarters in Berlin in the late 1970s, during which it was an isolated section of West Berlin[2] to one of Berlin's cultural centers in the middle of the now reunified city, known around the world for its alternative scene and counterculture. The borough is known for its very large percentage of immigrants and descendants of immigrants, many of whom are of Turkish ancestry. As of 2006, 31.6% of Kreuzberg's inhabitants did not have German citizenship.[5] While Kreuzberg thrives on its diverse culture and is still an attractive area for many, the district is also characterized by high levels of unemployment and some of the lowest average incomes in Berlin. The counterculture tradition of Kreuzberg led to a plurality of votes for the Green Party, which is unique among all Berlin boroughs. The local MP Canan Bayram is the only Green politician directly elected to the federal Bundestag parliament.Kreuzberg is bounded by the river Spree in the east. The Landwehrkanal flows through Kreuzberg from east to west, with the Paul-Lincke-Ufer running alongside it. Other characteristics are the old U-Bahn line of the present-day U1, the Görlitzer Park in SO 36 and the Viktoriapark on the slope of the Kreuzberg hill in SW 61. In contrast to many other areas of Berlin, which were villages before their integration into Berlin, Kreuzberg has a rather short history.[7] It was formed on 1 October 1920 by the Greater Berlin Act providing for the incorporation of suburbs and the reorganisation of Berlin into twenty boroughs. The eastern Friedrichsvorstadt, the southern Friedrichstadt, the western and southern Luisenstadt and the Tempelhofer Vorstadt were merged into the new VIth borough of Berlin, first named Hallesches Tor. On 27 September 1921 the borough assembly of Hallesches Tor decided to rename the borough after the homonymous hill.[8] Kreuzberg, literally meaning cross hill, is the point of highest elevation in the Kreuzberg locality, which is 66 m (217 ft) above sea level.[9] The hill is traditionally a place for weekend trips. It received its name from the 1821 Prussian National Monument for the Liberation Wars by Karl Friedrich Schinkel within the Viktoriapark, built in commemoration of the Napoleonic Wars. Except for its northernmost part, the quarter Friedrichstadt (established in the end of the 17th century), today's Kreuzberg was a very rural place until well into the 19th century. This changed when, in the 1860s, industrialization caused Berlin to grow rapidly. This called for extensive housing – much of which was built exploiting the dire needs of the poor, with widespread land speculation. Many of Kreuzberg's buildings originate from that time.[10] They were built on the streets laid out in the Hobrecht-Plan in an area that came to be known architecturally as the Wilhelmine Ring. Far into the 20th century, Kreuzberg was the most populous of Berlin's boroughs even in absolute numbers, with more than 400,000 people, although it was and still is geographically the smallest. As a result, with more than 60,000 people per square kilometer (155,000 people per square mile), Kreuzberg had the highest population density in Berlin. In addition to housing, Kreuzberg was also one center of Berlin's industry. The export quarter along Ritter Street consisted of many profitable small businesses, and the press quarter along Koch Street (Friedrichstadt) was the home of most of Germany's large newspapers, as well as the Ullstein, Scherl, and Mosse book publishers. Both of these industrial quarters were almost entirely destroyed by air raids during World War II, with the bombings of a single night from February 3, 1945. In remembrance of the old tradition, the Axel Springer press company erected its German headquarters at Kochstraße again, right next to the Berlin Wall. After World War II, Kreuzberg's housing rents were regulated by law which made investments unattractive. As a result, housing was of low quality, but cheap, which made the borough a prime target for immigrants coming to Germany (and Berlin).[11] Starting in the late 1960s, increasing numbers of students, artists, and immigrants began moving to Kreuzberg. Enclosed by the Berlin Wall on three sides, the area became famous for its alternative lifestyle and its squatters, especially the SO 36 part of Kreuzberg.[12] Starting in 1987, there have been violent riots in SO 36 on Labour day. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Kreuzberg suddenly found itself in the middle of the city again. The initially cheap rents and high degree of 19th century housing made some parts of the borough more attractive as a residential area for a much wider (and richer) variety of people. Today, Kreuzberg has one of the youngest populations of all European city boroughs, statistically, its population has been swapped completely twice in the last two decades. Berlin's 2001 administrative reform combined Kreuzberg with Friedrichshain to form the new borough of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg. Since the two areas are linked only by a single bridge over the Spree River, the Oberbaumbrücke, this combination seemed awkward to many residents.[citation needed] The two areas not being able to agree on a common location for the future borough's city hall, the present location in Friedrichshain was decided by flipping a five-Mark coin.Kreuzberg has historically been home to Berlin's punk rock movement as well as other alternative subcultures in Germany.[citation needed] The SO36 club remains a fixture on the Berlin music scene. It was originally focused on punk music and in the 1970s was often frequented by Iggy Pop and David Bowie. In those days the club rivalled New York's CBGB as one of the finest new-wave venues in the world. There has also been a significant influence stemming from African-American and hip hop culture on Kreuzberg's youth and the area has become a centre for rap and breakdance within Berlin. Though the majority of Kreuzberg's residents are of German or Turkish descent, some identify more with American or African-American culture.[14] Hip hop was largely introduced to the youth of Kreuzberg by the children of American servicemen who were stationed nearby until the reunification of Germany. The Carnival of Cultures, a large annual festival, celebrates different cultures and heritages with colourful street parades and festivities including street entertainment, food, arts and craft stalls, music and art. Kreuzberg has long been the epicenter of LGBTQ life and arts in Berlin. Kreuzberg is home to the Schwules Museum, established in the 1980s and dedicated to preserving, exhibiting, and discovering queer history, art and culture. German musician/DJ Robin Schulz's musical composition, Prayer in C, an adaptation of a prior song of the same name by Lilly Wood & the Prick, had most of the music video filmed in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg. Turkish-German filmmaker Neco Celik, who portrays the American influence over the youth culture in Kreuzberg in his first film, Alltag, notes that Kreuzberg is a kind of biotope where different nationalities live, but the environment determines their lives, not their nationalities. German musician Sven Regener's first novel, Berlin Blues, and third novel, Der Kleine Bruder (de), are set in the district of Kreuzberg. Kreuzberg is a song by English indie rock band Bloc Party on the album A Weekend in the City, which also mentions the East Side Gallery. American musician Stephen Malkmus mentions taking a locomotive to Kreuzberg in his song Black Book. Kreuzberg's bohemian way of life is reflected in the song Find the Time by English singer/songwriter Sam Duckworth's band Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly on the album Searching for the Hows and Whys. Kreuzberg-based Turkish/German rapper Killa Hakan mentions Kreuzberg in most of his songs, most notably in his 2007 single Kreuzberg City. The acclaimed documentary Pool of Princesses (Prinzessinnenbad) by Bettina Blümner (de) focuses on the lives of three young girls from Kreuzberg. Canadian musician Shotgun Jimmie's 2011 album Transistor Sister contains a song titled The King of Kreuzberg, wherein he sings about taking the train to Kreuzberg and jump[ing] right into it. English post-punk band Killing Joke have a song on their first album titled SO 36. Phoenix folk-punk band Andrew Jackson Jihad make a reference to Kreuzberg in the song Kokopelli Face Tattoo with the lyric Kreuz is German for Williams. Vocalist Sean Bonnette claims this pokes fun at the young hipness of Kreuzberg, in that it is similar to a German version of Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Kreuzberg appears in Shadowrun Returns's Dragonfall expansion as Kreuzbasar, a small self-sufficient walled community in the anarchic F-State of Berlin. In the novel No Man's Land by Michael Califra (Hadrian, 2015) the story’s narrator, an American expatriate named Richard, lives in the Kreuzberg district of West Berlin in the months prior to the fall of the Wall."

   "name": "Friedrichshain",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Simon-Dach-Straße, Karl-Marx-Allee/Frankfurter Straße, East Side Gallery. Friedrichshain, or Frederick’s Grove takes its name from the park at its northern border, Volkspark Friedrichshain, which was designed for the centenary celebrations of the coronation of Frederick the Great. Like its neighbor Kreuzberg, Friedrichshain was largely settled during the industrial revolution of the 19th century and remained a working-class district for much of its history. The locality was severely damaged by bombing during World War II, and after the war it became a district of East Berlin. During the 1950’s and 1960’s, a large development project was created at the site of the former Grosse Frankfurter Strasse, which eventually came to be known as Stalinallee. The name was later changed to Karl-Marx-Allee, and today half of the street retains this name and the other half is called Frankfurter Allee. Following the reunification, Friedrichshain became known as a popular location for young people and social activists due to its low rents and empty buildings. Squatters took over many of the buildings later leading to violent clashes with the police which still occasionally occur today. Like many of the inner-city districts of Berlin, Friedrichshain has been greatly gentrified in recent years and is considered one of the most fashionable areas of the city in which to live. While it remains a bit more graffitied than its neighbor Prenzlauer Berg, Friedrichshain also has some of the highest rents in the city. It is known for its bars, clubs, cafes, and its popular nightlife at areas such as Boxhagener Platz and Simon-Dach-Strasse. Like its neighbor Kreuzberg, Friedrichshain also has had its fair share of crime increases in recent years particularly around the popular nightlife spot of Warschauer Straße and the nearby subcultural compound RAW Gelände. Friedrichshain is named after the Volkspark Friedrichshain, a vast green park at the northern border with Prenzlauer Berg. In the Nazi era, the borough was called Horst-Wessel-Stadt. Friedrichshain is one of the trendy districts of Berlin and has experienced gentrification. Friedrichshain is defined by the following roads and places, starting clock-wise in the west: Lichtenberger Straße, Mollstraße, Otto-Braun-Straße, Am Friedrichshain, Virchowstraße, Margarete-Sommer-Straße, Danziger Straße, Landsberger Allee, Hausburgstraße, Thaerstraße, Eldenaer Straße, S-Bahn-Trasse, Kynaststraße, Stralauer Halbinsel, Spree. The largely working-class district was created in 1920 when Greater Berlin was established by referendum, incorporating several surrounding settlements. Friedrichshain united the Frankfurter Vorstadt, already part of Berlin, and the villages of Boxhagen and Stralau. It took its name (meaning 'Frederick's Grove') from the Volkspark ('People's Park'), which was planned in 1840 to commemorate the centenary of Frederick the Great’s coronation. Much of the district was settled in the rapid industrialization of the 19th and early 20th centuries, led by growth in manufacturing and crafts. It owed much to the opening of the railway line between Berlin and Frankfurt (Oder) in 1846 (which terminated near the site of today's Berlin Ostbahnhof), and the opening of the first waterworks in 1865 at Stralauer Tor. In 1874 the Krankenhaus im Friedrichshain was opened, Berlin's first hospital beside the university clinic Charité. In the early 1900s, the district's largest employer was the Knorr-Bremse brake factory, the Knorrpromenade, one of Friedrichshain's most attractive streets, was built to house the management. The street network of Friedrichhain was originally specified in the Hobrecht-Plan and the area was part of what came to be known architecturally as the Wilhelmine Ring. When the Nazis came to power in 1933, the district was renamed Horst-Wessel-Stadt after the Nazi activist and writer of the Nazi hymn whose slow death, after being shot by communists, in Friedrichshain hospital in 1930 was turned into a propaganda event by Joseph Goebbels. During World War II Friedrichshain was one of the most badly damaged parts of Berlin, as Allied strategic bombers specifically targeted its industries. As late as the nineties, some buildings still displayed bullet holes from the intense house to house fighting during the Battle of Berlin. After the war ended, the boundary between the US and Soviet occupation sectors ran between Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg, with Friedrichshain in the east and Kreuzberg in the west. This became a sealed border between East and West Berlin when the Berlin Wall was built in 1961. Stalinallee (previously Große Frankfurter Straße) was built in Friedrichshain in the late 1940s and early 1950s as a prestige project, the architecture of its 'workers' palaces' is strongly reminiscent of the ostentatious Soviet-era Moscow boulevards and is sometimes mockingly described as Zuckerbäckerstil ('wedding cake style'). The 1953 uprising had its origins in these construction projects, as increased work quotas led to protests that soon spread throughout East Germany, and were only put down by armed Soviet intervention. In the period of De-Stalinization following the Soviet leader's death, the boulevard was renamed Karl-Marx-Allee at one end and Frankfurter Allee at the other. From this time onwards, Friedrichshain often featured on East Berlin's cultural map: in 1962 the Kosmos, East Germany's largest cinema, was opened, followed in 1981 by the country's most ambitious swimming and sports complex, the Sport- und Erholungszentrum. Neither of these buildings serve their original function today. In the course of the changes following the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, the free elections in March 1990 and leading up to German reunification the following October, Friedrichshain began to develop a reputation as a young, dynamic district, thanks in part to low rents and the many empty apartments that also attracted the attention of squatters including many from former West Berlin. On 14 November that year, Friedrichshain experienced violent clashes when hundreds of squatters were forcefully evicted from houses in Mainzer Straße by police acting on the orders of the Senate of the recently united city, an act which would trigger the fall of the governing coalition when the Green Party withdrew in protest. In the following years further squatters were evicted under the hardline conservative Senator for the Interior, but others were able to buy the houses they lived in, and they remain a distinct (counter-)cultural influence in the district to this day. Alongside the neighboring districts of Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg, and Kreuzberg, Friedrichshain is now considered one of Berlin's most fashionable areas, and is home to numerous design and media companies including MTV Central Europe. It is known for its many bars, clubs, pubs, and cafes, concentrated in the vicinity of Simon-Dach-Straße and Boxhagener Platz. There were numerous squats in Friedrichshain, with many in and around Rigaer Straße, Mainzer Straße and Scharnweber Straße. In contrast to the districts of Prenzlauer Berg and Mitte, which have experienced high levels of demographic change and rented accommodation is higher, it is only since the late 1990s that Friedrichshain has undergone a similar trend. Following German reunification, the availability of comparatively cheap rented accommodation attracted students and artists. Nowadays numerous restoration works are under way and Friedrichshain is developing at a fast pace becoming more and more gentrified itself. At the opposite end of the district, the Volkspark Friedrichshain is a large park serving the densely populated area of Prenzlauer Berg on the other side. Its distinctive features include the Märchenbrunnen (Fairytale Fountain) and two green and pleasant mountains consisting purely of rubble and the ruins of two World War II Flak towers. Peaceful green oases like the Volkspark Friedrichshain offer opportunities for sports and recreation in leafy nature. The Spreeufer is lovely for walks along the riverside. Concerning its culinary offerings, this area also boasts a great choice of restaurants in all price ranges as well as many charming cafés. Culture lovers enjoy this neighborhood because of various small exhibition spaces, venues, cinemas and the Berlin Kriminal Theater that specializes in crime stories. Frankfurter Allee features various shopping facilities as well as the Ring-Center shopping mall. Points of interest: East Side Gallery, a part of the Berlin Wall that was turned into an international outdoor gallery, Karl-Marx-Allee, a boulevard lined with buildings in the Stalinist style, originally called Stalinallee, Frankfurter Tor, two landmark towers on Karl-Marx-Allee, which resemble the church domes on Gendarmenmarkt, Oberbaumbrücke, a road and rail bridge connecting Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain built in North German brick, Fairytale Fountain in Volkspark Friedrichshain, Simon-Dach-Straße, a street with numerous pubs, Boxhagener Platz, heart of the Friedrichshain Kiez or neighborhood, Straße der Pariser Kommune, a street beginning a block north of the Karl-Marx-Allee and extending to the banks of the Spree, Samariterviertel with the Samariterkirche (Church of the Good Samaritan), Berlin Ostbahnhof, Volkspark Friedrichshain, with its Memorial to Polish Soldiers and German Anti-Fascists, Skatehall Berlin, Revaler Strasse 99, Cassiopeia Berlin, Revaler Strasse 99, Bänschstraße, a boulevard lined with buildings in the Jugendstil in Berlin Friedrichshain, Stralau peninsula, a 5 min walk from train station Treptower Park. A riverside path runs around the entire peninsula and the Rummelsburger See lake.

   "name": "Friedrichsfelde",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Tierpark Founded in the early 13th century, Friedrichsfelde was originally called Rosenfelde. The name was changed in 1699 to Friedrichsfelde to honor the Prince-Elector Fredrick III of Brandenburg. A village church was built in the late 13th century, but is no longer standing. The old village center with historical buildings and layout can still be found in the area of Alt-Friedrichsfelde in the north east of the locality. In 1695, the Schloss Friedrichsfelde was built and still remains well intact thanks to the preservation efforts of the Tierpark Berlin. As with the other outer localities and districts of Berlin, Friedrichsfelde was incorporated into the city in 1920 with the Greater Berlin Act. Today, Friedrichsfelde is known for its modern high-rises built between the 1960’s and 1990’s and the Tierpark Berlin (one of Berlin’s two zoos) which takes up much of the eastern part of the locality. It is well connected with S-Bahn, U-Bahn, Tram, and Bus lines and has relatively inexpensive rents. The locality was first mentioned in a document of 1265 with the name of Rosenfelde. In 1699 it was renamed Friedrichsfelde after the Prince-Elector Frederick III of Brandenburg.[1] Until 1920 it was an autonomous municipality of the former Niederbarnim district, merged into Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act. Located in eastern suburb of Berlin, Friedrichsfelde borders with the localities of Lichtenberg, Rummelsburg, Karlshorst, Marzahn and Biesdorf (both in Marzahn-Hellersdorf district). In its south-eastern corner is situated the Tierpark Berlin, the second zoo of the city."

   "name": "Karlshorst",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Deutsch-Russisches Museum Berlin-Karlshorst, Pfarrkirche Zur frohen Botschaft Unlike many of the neighboring localities, Karlshorst has a relatively recent history. It was first mentioned in 1825 as Vorwerk Carl Horst, so named after Carl von Tresckow who owned the manor (Rittersguts) Friedrichsfelde. A horst is a slightly elevated overgrown wetland or woods. The village was actually founded in 1895 when the first housing colony was built along Lehndorffstraße. Over the next several decades the Karlshorst was developed following the basic ideas of the city planner Oscar Gregorovius. After the completion of the Karlshorst station in 1902, the area became a popular villa colony and was soon dubbed the Dahlem of the East, referring to the affluent suburb in the southwest of Berlin. Karlshorst was incorporated into Berlin in 1920 with the Greater Berlin Act and became a part of the greater district of Lichtenberg. During the Nazi era, the Pionierschule I (later called the Festungspionierschule) an officer training school for the Wehrmacht was built. It was here that the unconditional surrender of the Wehrmacht was signed from the 8th to the 9th of May, 1945. In 1949, the building became the headquarters of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany and later the largest headquarters of the KGB outside of the USSR. After the partition of Germany, Karlshorst was the home to many embassies and the residence of many foreign diplomats. Following the reunification of Germany, Karlshorst saw much renovation and infrastructure developments which led to it once again becoming a popular and affluent residential area. Many single-family homes have been built in the area, including the development of the new neighborhood of the Gartenstadt Karlshorst.  Located there are a harness racing track and the Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft Berlin (HTW), the largest University of Applied Sciences in Berlin, and the German-Russian Museum Berlin-Karlshorst. Established in 1895 as the Carlshorst mansion's colony, Karlshorst from 1901 had access to the railway line from Berlin to Breslau (today Wrocław, Poland) and developed to a quite affluent residential area, sometimes referred to as Dahlem of the East. The locality encompasses the Waldsiedlung, a garden city laid out between 1919 and 1921 according to plans by Peter Behrens. In April 1945, as the Red Army approached the Reich's capital, Marshal Georgy Zhukov, commander of the 1st Belorussian Front, established his headquarters at a former Wehrmacht officer's mess hall in Karlshorst, where on May 8, the unconditional surrender of the German forces was presented to Zhukov by Colonel-General Hans-Jürgen Stumpff as the representative of the Luftwaffe, Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel as Chief of Staff of OKW, and Admiral Hans-Georg von Friedeburg as Commander-in-Chief of the Kriegsmarine. From 1945 to 1949 the building complex served as the headquarters of the Soviet Military Administration in Germany. After the establishment of the German Democratic Republic it hosted the 6th Independent Motorized Rifle Brigade, the Soviets' Berlin Brigade, until the last Russian soldiers left Karlshorst in 1994. The former headquarters has been made the home of the German-Russian Museum Berlin-Karlshorst (Deutsch-Russisches Museum Berlin-Karlshorst) [1], formerly called the Capitulation Museum."

   "name": "Lichtenberg",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Gedenkstätte der Sozialisten, Rathaus Lichtenberg, Landschaftspark Herzberge. Founded during the settlement of the Barnim in 1230, but was first mentioned during a land dispute over the boundary between the villages of Stralau and Rosenfelde in 1288. Lichtenberg was purchased by the city of Berlin and was administered by the city, but there weren’t strong ties between the two until the late 18th century when wealthy families, officers, and politicians moved to the area and built mansions and villas. Despite this, Lichtenberg remained an undeveloped, rural village into the 19th century. This changed rapidly following a fire in 1833 which destroyed much of the village and later in the century the area developed into a strong economic area which continued through World War II. With its affordable rents, closeness to trendy Friedrichshain, and decent public transport options, Lichtenberg is quickly becoming a popular choice for those seeking an urban residence without the negatives of the gentrified inner-city. The large parkland Landschaftspark Herzeberge makes up most of the eastern part of the locality, and the expansive Vietnamese shopping center the Dong Xuan Center is a perennial favorite for Berliners shopping for Asian ingredients. The southern part of the locality is well connected with S-Bahn and U-Bahn, but the northern parts are accessed only with bus and tram which tend to have longer wait times than in the city center. The historic village of Lichtenberg, today also called Alt-Lichtenberg, was founded about 1230, due to the German colonization of the territory of Barnim. The settlement around the fieldstone church was first mentioned in a 1288 deed, its estates were acquired by the neighbouring City of Berlin in 1391. Alt-Lichtenberg suffered severely during the Thirty Years' War and remained a small village at the Berlin gates until in the late 18th century Prussian noblemen like general Wichard Joachim Heinrich von Möllendorf built their residences here. In 1815 the Lichtenberg estate became a property of the Prussian chancellor Karl August von Hardenberg. The village came to be a residential area and a suburb of Berlin from the mid 19th century on. A new town hall was erected in 1898 and in 1907 Lichtenberg received town privileges. Originally an independent city, it became part of Berlin in 1920 in the Greater Berlin Act. Lichtenberg is located in the middle of its District. It borders with Friedrichshain (in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg), Prenzlauer Berg (in Pankow), Fennpfuhl, Alt-Hohenschönhausen, Rummelsburg, Friedrichsfelde and Marzahn (in Marzahn-Hellersdorf). It has an area of 7.22 square kilometres (2.79 sq mi). Lichtenberg is a developing center of Asian culture and dubbed the eastern Asiatown or Chinatown of Berlin. The Dong Xuan Center around Herzbergstrasse on former industrial grounds is a development quarter with many different Asian businesses, various shops, food producers and wholesalers/distributors, residential areas and cultural offers."

   "name": "Falkenberg",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Gutsarbeiterhaus, Katholische Kirche Sankt Konrad von Parzham, Gehrensee, Tierheim Berlin. As a small farming estate founded in the 13th century, Falkenberg had a quiet history until it was purchased by Marie-Elizabeth von Humboldt, the mother of Wilhelm and Alexander von Humboldt, in 1791. During her time as the landowner of the area, she commissioned the Berlin architect Paul Ludwig Simon to remodel the village church in an Egyptian style which was popular following Napoleon’s campaign in Egypt. Following her death, Falkenberg was inherited by her son Ferdinand von Holwede and later he sold it to a member of the aristocratic family von Alvensleben. In 1920, it was incorporated into the city of Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act, and only saw minor developments in the 1930’s and 1940’s which included the construction of the local Catholic Church. On April 21st, 1945, the village church (Dorfkirche Falkenberg) was blown up by the Waffen SS to prevent the advancing Red Army from using the steeple as a strategic location. Unlike many of other areas in East Berlin, Falkenberg was not rapidly developed with large housing estates. It remains today a sparsely developed area, the majority of the locality comprised of fields, aside from the southern and eastern borders. The northeastern part of the locality borders on the neighboring state of Brandenburg. Due to its distance from the city center, the rental prices are low. It is served by the bus lines 197 and N97, and the S-Bahn station S Ahrensfelde which is in the neighboring locality of Marzahn. The settlement, inhabited by farmers from the Barnim, was first mentioned in 1370 on a document of Otto V, Duke of Bavaria. Until 1920, it was a municipality of Niederbarnim district, merged into Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act. Situated in northeastern suburb of Berlin, Falkenberg is bounded by the Brandenburger municipality of Ahrensfelde, in Barnim district. It borders with the Berliner localities of Wartenberg, Neu-Hohenschönhausen and Marzahn (in Marzahn-Hellersdorf)."

   "description": "Remarkable places: Malchower See, Malchower Aue The area of Malchow has a long history of settlement with archaeological evidence found which suggests there have been people living in the area since around 5000 BC. It was settled by Germans farmers around 1230 and first mentioned in a deed as Malchowe in 1344. During the 17th century, Malchow was developed with a forge, windmill, orphanage, and the village church was renovated. It was privately owned until 1882, when it was purchased by the city of Berlin to be used as sewage treatment area. In the late 1920’s it received a bus connection to Weißensee and in the 1930’s a couple of residential settlements were built. Malchow is a small, rural locality, mainly developed along the road Dorfstraße in the west. Much of the district is comprised of fields and farmland with small garden allotments (Kleingartenanlage) to the north. It is the least populated locality of Berlin with less than 500 inhabitants. Public transport is limited to the bus lines 154 and 259 along Dorfstraße, but the S-Bahn station S Wartenberg is nearby in neighboring locality Neu-Hohenschönhausen. With a population of 450 (2008) it is the least-populated Berliner Ortsteil. The locality was first mentioned in 1344. Until 1920 it was an autonomous municipality merged into Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act. A former civil parish of it, Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow, was divided from Malchow in 1985, becoming an Ortsteil of the former borough of Weißensee (still part of Pankow district in 2001). Malchow is located in the north-eastern suburb of Berlin, and counts in its territory a little lake named Malchower See. It borders with the localities of Wartenberg, Neu-Hohenschönhausen and Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow."

   "name": "Wartenberg",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Landschaftspark Wartenberger Feldmark As with much of the surrounding area, Wartenberg was developed as a farming estate during the 13th century. The village church (Dorfkirche Wartenberg) was completed around this same time. Until 1448, the area was privately owned by several families of Berlin and Cölln, but was later owned by Frederick II of Brandenburg, the Iron. In 1882, the estate was purchased by the city of Berlin for use as a sewage farm. On April 21st, 1945, the village church, along with the churches in neighboring Falkenberg and Malchow, was destroyed to prevent the advancing Red Army from gaining a tactical advantage. With single-family homes, small garden allotments (Kleingartenanlage), and limited apartment buildings, Wartenberg is a green, rural locality. To the south it borders Neu-Hohenschönhausen with its large GDR built high-rise estates. It is one of the least expensive areas to live in Berlin, but it has limited recreational options. The locality was established in the course of the German Ostsiedlung after the establishment of the Margraviate of Brandenburg by Albert the Bear in 1157. It was first mentioned in a 1270 margravial deed as Wardenberge and again in the 1375 domesday book of Emperor Charles IV. The estates of Wartenberg manor were acquired by the City of Berlin in 1882. Until 1920, it was a municipality in the former Niederbarnim district of the Prussian Brandenburg Province, then merged into Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act. Wartenberg is located in the north-eastern suburb of Berlin and borders with the Brandenburger village of Lindenberg (part of Ahrensfelde municipality), in Barnim district.

   "name": "Alt-Hohenschönhausen",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Sportforum Hohenschönhausen. Initially a small farming village, Alt-Hohenschönhausen developed similarly to its neighbors. In the 15th century, it became the property of the powerful Röbel family who built a manor in the area it became an affluent holding. During the Thirty Years War (1618-1648), the village was looted and suffered greatly from the famine and plague that followed. The Röbel family sold the village in the mid-18th century, and farmlands were developed for the cultivation of fruits and wheat. In the late-19th century, the population began to increase as Berlin residents moved to the outskirts of the city and it was at this time that multi-story tenement houses were built. Following World War II, the area was occupied by Soviet forces who built a prison camp, Special Camp No. 3, which was known for its terrible conditions. Following the closing of this camp, a prison was built in the area which was primarily used by the East German state security service, to house those who tried to defect to the west and political prisoners. Since 1994, the prison has been opened as a memorial. Alt-Hohenschönhausen is a large suburban locality, with a mix of single-family homes, small garden allotments, prefab high-rises, modern apartment buildings, and industrial areas. During the 1970’s parts of the locality were developed by the East German government as socialist housing projects. It is also home of a large sports hall (Sportforum Hohenschönhausen) which is the largest German Olympic training area. It is one of the cheaper rental areas of the suburbs of Berlin, and is more urban that many of the surrounding localities which give it greater shopping possibilities. Hohenschönhausen Castle is located in Alt-Hohenschönhausen. The Association Hohenschönhausen Castle cares for the restoration and cultural revitalization of this manor house and regularly organizes different events in the castle, such as exhibitions, readings, and concerts. The earliest evidence of settlement in Alt-Hohenschönhausen are from the Bronze Age, and when the settlement history of the wider Berlin area is taken into consideration, there could have been settlements there since 10,000BC. Alt-Hohenschönhausen was first mentioned in 1230. In the initial centuries of the Common Era the area was mainly inhabited by the Sprevane and Hevelli tribes. By the 13th century the area had been colonised by Germans, particularly from the settlement of Schönhausen, during the eastward migration and settlement of Germans in the medieval period. By the 14th century, the prefix Hoh (high) was added to the name of the village to distinguish itself from the southerly village of Niederschönhausen. The first definitive written record of Hohenschönhausen is from an official certificate to Conradus de Schonehusen, dated 19 August 1284. From 1626 Hohenschönhausen was affected by the Thirty Years' War. Apart from the Swedish forces who were passing through the area, the troops of Albrecht von Wallenstein also plundered the area and its surroundings, with only the village church remaining undamaged. The result of this was a large-scale desertion of the area by its inhabitants and widespread famine. In the following years, The Plague and other epidemics were reported, including a plague of locusts in 1651. As a result of these factors, the village had lost 58% of its inhabitants by the mid-17th century. Hohenschönhausen was affected by the Seven Years' War, and was plundered by Austrian and Russian troops after Frederick the Great's defeat at the Battle of Kunersdorf. From 1817 the village and the surrounding estates were under the control of the local state councillor, Christian Friedrich Scharnweber. Under his tenure and those of his successors, Hohenschönhausen began expanding along the road to Berlin. Apart from the settlements, at this point cereals were also widely grown and, after the easing of restrictions in 1810, milled on-site. As the 19th century progressed and Germany began to industrialise, Hohenschönhausen benefitted from investment in infrastructure, such as the opening of an electric tram line in 1899, and a brewery which opened in the early 1890s. With the Greater Berlin Act of October 1920, Alt-Hohenschönhausen officially became incorporated as part of Greater Berlin within the Weißensee district. Along with the rest of the city, Hohenschönhausen saw food and housing shortages throughout the financial crisis of the mid-1920s. The district was broadly left-wing in the early 1930s, when the Nazi Party took power in 1933, the majority of residents were members of the social democratic parties, the USPD and the SPD. Nevertheless, more than 100 local civil servants were replaced by officials more favourable to the Party on 7 April 1933. After the pogroms of Kristallnacht on 9 November 1938, only some isolated Jews were still allowed to carry out their business, among them was Hohenschönhausen doctor Victor Aronstein, whose waiting room served as a secret meeting place for communists and social democrats until 1939.[2] In 1938 the district's synagogue was completely destroyed by the Nazis, its location is now the site of a memorial to the persecuted Jews of Hohenschönhausen. Together with Wartenberg, Falkenberg and Marzahn, Hohenschönhausen was one of the first parts of Greater Berlin to be capitulated by the Red Army in the evening of 21 April 1945. Like most of Berlin, the immediate problems facing the area included outbreaks of Typhus and Shigellosis, a lack of gas and electricity, and widespread homelessness and orphancy. By the end of the summer of 1945, schools had re-opened and Hohenschönhausen Castle began functioning as a hospital, which continued until 1989. At around the same time, the Soviet secret police took over a building in an industrial area formerly occupied by the Nazi welfare organisation, the NSV,[3] and converted into use as a detainment and transit camp for prisoners of war, which continued to be used until the beginning of the fall of the German Democratic Republic in 1989. On 18 June 1953 more than 1,000 residents of Alt-Hohenschönhausen took part in the mass uprising which spread throughout the country. Like most of the country, the district saw a reduction in its population up until 1961 when the Berlin Wall was built. In the 1970s the district was expanded with the construction of new high-rise apartment buildings. Thanks to the secretive nature of the prison in Hohenschönhausen, a large part of the district where the facility was located was left blank on official maps. After Die Wende in 1989, East and West Berlin merged to form the federal state of Berlin in 1990. On 1 January 2001 the former borough of Hohenschönhausen consisting of Alt-Hohenschönhausen as well as the localities Neu-Hohenschönhausen, Malchow, Wartenberg and Falkenberg was merged with the borough of Lichtenberg into the contemporary borough of Lichtenberg."

Neu-Hohenschönhausen is a modern locality purpose-built starting in the 1970’s as social housing for up to 25,000 people. This resulted in the housing estates Hohenschönhausen I and Hohenschönhausen II. Due to the popularity of these flats, the development plans for the area expanded and similar buildings were built through the 1980’s. It is a quiet residential locality made up of prefab high-rises (Plattenbauten). There are not many shopping or entertainment options in Neu-Hohenschönhausen, and the prices of the flats are some of the lowest in the city. It is also well connected with both S-Bahn and tram which go directly to the inner-city. The locality, still inhabited in the 19th century, hadn't a different name from Alt-Hohenschönhausen as part of it. The designation was used from the 1960s for this local part, to distinguish it from the old town."

   "name": "Fennpfuhl",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Fennpfuhl Park, Lederkontor Fabrik. In the mid 1900’s, there was a great need for social housing in East Berlin and so large prefab high-rise housing estates were planned throughout the city. The area that became known as Fennpfuhl was initially planned out in the 1960’s, and construction was done from 1972 until 1986. A whole community was planned and built including a registry office and a center including shops, a swimming pool, sports hall, and department store. After the reunification of Germany, the houses were almost entirely renovated. Although perhaps not the most architecturally beautiful of localities, Fennpfuhl’s great advantage is its close distance to the trendy district of Friedrichshain. This makes its rents more competitive than other localities in the district of Lichtenberg. It is well connected with trams and the southern part of the locality borders the S-Bahn Ring line stop at Storkower Straße. In April 1961, the land development of the area, called Lichtenberg (Nord) at that time, was begun, and planning was subdivided into three sections. The area to be built upon covered an area of 175 hectares (430 acres). In the Erich-Kuttner-Straße on the edge of the area (section I), the first Plattenbau, one of the most commonly built type of residence in East Germany, was built. The building, which was built as an experimental sample, is under monument protection today.[2] On December 2, 1972, construction of the quarter began, the plan being to develop an area for almost 50,000 inhabitants. Populated since the early 1970s, it was officially completed on May 12, 1986."

   "description": "Remarkable places: Museum des bezirks Lichtenberg, Erlöserkirche. Rummelsburg has a later history than most of the surrounding area, having only been founded in the 17th century. It was initially the location of a brickyard built along the Rummelsburger Lake, and soon it also developed into a dairy farm. In the late 19th century, Rummelsburg saw further development with the building of an orphanage and a church (Erlöserkirche) along with tenement houses. The area rapidly grew in size during this time period due to the industrial development of Berlin, and by 1910 more than 50,000 people lived in the locality. Following World War II, it became a residential part of East Berlin. Rummelsburg has long been a popular residential area, and it is becoming increasingly so as its neighboring district of Friedrichshain becomes more popular and expensive. It is a heavily settled, urban community, but there is still a good amount of green space. Rental prices are higher than other areas of the district, but it is well connected to public transport and is close to the trendy Friedrichshain. To the south of the S-Bahn tracks and along the Rummelsburger See is primarily industrial areas although there have been some new residential developments built there. The locality was founded in 1669 and on January 30, 1889 became a rural municipality, with the name of Boxhagen-Rummelsburg. Merged in 1912 in the town of Lichtenberg, in 1920 it was incorporated in Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act."

   "description": "Remarkable places: Schloss Biesdorf, Biesdorfer Dorfkirche. As a small village founded during the German eastward expansion (Ostsiedlung), Biesdorf had a modest beginning which was significantly devastated during the Thirty Years War. Thereafter, it came under the control of Friedrich Wilhelm, Elector of Brandenburg and from then on was controlled by his successors and later the King of Prussia until 1874. In 1920, Biesdorf joined district of Lichtenberg with the Greater Berlin Act. When the Nazis came into power, Biesdorf was the location of forced labor camps which held mostly French and Soviet POWs. In addition, hundreds of patients of local institution for epileptics were sterilized and many were later deported to death camps. Following World War II, Biesdorf became part of the Soviet controlled East Berlin. Biesdorf is a densely populated, middle-class district made up of mostly single and multifamily homes. It is readily accessible with public transport, though the S-Bahn and U-Bahn lines run through the center parts of the district. The north and south are served by bus lines. While Biesdorf does not have many parks, to the west it borders to the Tierpark, one of Berlin’s two zoos, and the grounds of the Schloss Biesdorf are open to the public. Biesdorf is one of the most popular localities of Marzahn-Hellersdorf and the rental prices reflect this, although they are still reasonable compared to inner-city prices. Biesdorf was mentioned for the first time in a document of 1375, the Landbuch (land book) of Charles IV, with its ancient names Bysterstorff and/or Bisterstorff. Until 1920 it was a municipality of the former Niederbarnim district, merged in Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act, and part of Lichtenberg district until 1933. From 1949 to 1990, during the Cold War, it was part of East Berlin."

In 1886, the city of Berlin purchased the estate of Hellersdorf and a hospital for the chronically ill was built. After World War II, it became part of the Soviet controlled East Berlin. During the 1970’s, it was heavily developed and several Plattenbauten (prefab high-rise apartment buildings) were built. Following the reunification of Germany, Hellersdorf was further developed with the Helle Mitte, a community center which was finished in 1997. Hellersdorf is an inexpensive suburb of Berlin with lots of green spaces and inexpensive flats. Much of the locality is comprised of Plattenbauten, but many of the flats were renovated in the 1990’s and the area has started to become a popular location for families looking for inexpensive, suburban living. The entire locality is well connected by U-Bahn and Tram, and U5 lines goes directly to Alexanderplatz in thirty minutes. Although the area has a reputation of far-right activity, in recent years this has begun to change and now Hellersdorf is becoming a more popular location for those searching for a budget-friendly area of Berlin to live. Before German reunification in 1989 it was part of East Berlin. Situated at the eastern part of Berlin, the area is mainly a large housing estate from the 1980s, made up of Plattenbau (concrete slab) buildings. The historic village of Helwichstorpp was first mentioned in a 1375 land registry of Emperor Charles IV of Luxembourg, then also Margrave of Brandenburg. The city of Berlin acquired the former Hellersdorf manor in 1886, it was finally incorporated by the 1920 Greater Berlin Act as a part of the Lichtenberg borough. During German reunification on October 3, 1990, a small part of Honow (primarily around the last two stations of U5) was annexed by this borough. Gründerzeit Museum, founded by Charlotte von Mahlsdorf and situated in the building Gutshaus Mahlsdorf. This museum is dedicated to life around the 20th century Berlin Hellersdorf"

   "name": "Kaulsdorf",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Dorfkirche Kaulsdorf/Jesuskirche, Kaulsdorfer Seen. Built from the remains of a previous Slavic settlement, Kaulsdorf (originally Caulstorp) was founded in the late 12th century during the German eastward expansion (Ostsiedlung). The area was devastated during the Thirty Years War in 1638 and wasn’t reoccupied until 1652. In 1920, it was incorporated into the district of Lichtenberg during the Greater Berlin Act. Following World War II, Kaulsdorf became part of Soviet controlled East Berlin. Along with neighboring localities Mahlsdorf and Biesdorf, Kaulsdorf is part of Germany’s largest contiguous area of single and multifamily homes. It is densely settled, but there is a large park with several lakes in the central-east part of the locality. It is largely a middle-class area with single-family homes. Rental prices are reasonable, though not as inexpensive as other areas in the district such as Marzahn or Mahlsdorf, however there are not many public transport options which can make it very remote from the city center. The village was first mentioned as Caulstorp in a 1347 deed of gift by margrave Louis I of Brandenburg to the Kaland monastic brotherhood in Bernau. During the Thirty Years' War it was completely devastated by armed conflicts and epidemics. The village church (aka Jesus Church) dates back to the 14th century, its Romanesque apse may be preserved from a predecessing building. The steeple was attached in 1875 and today houses a small museum. For the Modern Catholic church St. Martin built in 1929-1930, Charles Crodel from 1942 to 1946 created 26 windows and nine round windows as well as a mosaic wall and an enamel work for the altar."

   "name": "Mahlsdorf",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Gründerzeitmuseum, Dorfkirche Mahlsdorf, Berliner Balkon. Mahlsdorf developed as a north-south oriented linear settlement in the early 13th century. South of the church the old Berlin-Frankfurt (Oder)-Poznań-Gniezno trade route ran, which provided the town with much of its economic livelihood. The village church was built in the 13th century and is still actively used. Mahlsdorf was incorporated into Berlin in 1920 and after World War II became part of the Soviet controlled East Berlin. From 1959 to 1989, the former cinema Lichtburg in Mahlsdorf was the production location of the popular GDR children’s television program Unser Sandmännchen. Mahlsdorf is a densely populated suburb largely made up of single and multifamily homes. While rental prices are considerably lower than in the inner-city, the access to public transport can be sparse. Together with neighboring localities Biesdorf and Kaulsdorf, it is part of the largest contiguous area of single and multifamily homes in Germany. The locality was mentioned for the first time in a document of 1345, named as Malterstorp. Until 1920 it was a municipality of the former Niederbarnim district, merged into Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act"

   "name": "Marzahn",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Marzahner Bockwindmühle, Marzahner Dorfkirche, Gärten der Welt. Similar to many of the surrounding areas, the area which became the village of Marzahn was founded during the German eastward expansion (Ostsiedlung) of the early 13th century. It was first documented in a deed in 1300 as the village of Morczane by the Margrave Albert III of Brandenburg-Salzwedel. For much of its history, Marzahn was a small, rural village and was incorporated into Berlin in 1920 as part of the Greater Berlin Act which expanded the borders of the city of Berlin to several outlying villages. Unfortunately, the twentieth century saw a darker period for Marzahn. In 1936, it became the location of the first camp for foreign races (Fremdrassige), a labor camp for Romani. It was originally opened as a way to clear the city of Romani prior to the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, but it soon became the largest gypsy camp in Germany. Thousands were incarcerated in the camp, and many of these were eventually sent to their deaths at the camps of Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen. Marzahn was also the location of the two forced labor camps whose prisoners were made to work at a nearby factory of Hasse & Wrede and local farms. Following World War II, Marzahn became a part of the Soviet controlled East Berlin and later became the location of several housing developments. With its mix of Plattenbauten (prefab high-rise apartment buildings) and single-family homes, Marzahn offers a wide variety of residential options for those seeking more affordable rents as inner-city prices increase. Although it is one of the more distant suburbs of Berlin, it is well connected by S-Bahn, tram, and bus. It also has the benefit of the Eastgate shopping center which is the fifth-largest in Berlin. Marzahn has long had poor reputation due to far-right activity in the area. However, the situation has significantly improved in recent years and there have been broad restoration work done on buildings and parks. The historic village of Marzahn was first mentioned as Morczane in a 1300 deed by Margrave Albert III of Brandenburg-Salzwedel, when he granted the estates to the Friedland Cistercian abbey (in today's Neuhardenberg). After the Thirty Years' War it fell to Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg. The new village church was finished in 1871 according to plans by Friedrich August Stüler, another landmark is the Marzahn post mill, rebuilt in 1994. The village became part of Greater Berlin in 1920, as a locality of the Lichtenberg district. Marzahn was the site of a labour camp (today a water treatment plant), where Romani were interned during the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, away from visitors' eyes. As a part of the Nazi Porajmos extermination policy, up to 2000 inmates remained there until in 1943 they were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where most of them were gassed. In 1941 the large factory of the Carl Hasse & Wrede machine tool company (now Knorr-Bremse) was erected, where hundreds forced labourers were employed. The victims were buried at the nearby Parkfriedhof, a memorial marks the site. On April 21, 1945 the district of Marzahn was the first in Berlin to be conquered by the Red Army under General Nikolai Berzarin. The first freed house stands on Landsberger Allee. A part of East Berlin from 1949, Marzahn remained a rural site until from 1977 vast housing estates were built on its fields by order of the East German authorities. The construction, carried out in the typical plattenbau style, dragged on until the late 1980s. In the course of the population growth Marzahn was separated from Lichtenberg in 1979 to become a borough in its own right and in 1986 the new Hellersdorf district (including Kaulsdorf and Mahlsdorf) was split from it. In 1987 Marzahn hosted the Berliner Gartenschau, a horticulture show, on the occasion of Berlin's 750th anniversary. The area today called Erholungspark Marzahn includes the Gärten der Welt (Gardens of the World) project, showing Chinese, Japanese, Balinese and Korean, labyrinths modelled on Hampton Court Palace and Chartres Cathedral as well as a garden of the Italian Renaissance. After 1989, the Marzahn estate became known for neo-Nazis and foreigners were warned not even to visit there."

   "name": "Mitte",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Alexanderplatz, Hackescher Markt, Friedrichstraße. The word Mitte means middle in English, and is a fitting name for the most central and oldest of all the Berlin districts. In medieval times, much of the area which now makes up the district Mitte was comprised of two towns, Alt-Berlin and Cölln which in time grew together to make up city of Berlin. In 1920, Mitte became the first district of Berlin during the Greater Berlin Act (Groß-Berlin-Gesetz) and was developed during the reign of the Prussians. Heavily damaged during World War II, Mitte later became the city centre of East Berlin.  Mitte contains some of the most important museums and cultural sights of the city. At the centre of the district is the Museum Island (Museumsinsel) which is named for the area where five internationally important museums are located as well as the Berlin Cathedral (Berliner Dom). To the east is the former East Berlin hub Alexanderplatz, famous for its TV Tower (Fernsehturm), as well as the city hall of Berlin (Rotes Rathaus). To the west is the State Opera of Berlin (Staatsoper), Humboldt University, the shop street Friedrichstraße, the Holocaust Memorial, and the Brandenburg Gate (Brandenburger Tor). Due to its prime location and historical significance, Mitte was the first of the former East Berlin districts to gentrify and now has some of the highest rents in the city. However, along with the high rents this district is popular for its trendy cafes, restaurants and beautiful historic streets. It is also easily accessible with public transport. It comprises the historic centre of Alt-Berlin around the churches of St. Nicholas and St. Mary, renowned Museum Island, the city hall Rotes Rathaus, the city administrative building Altes Stadthaus, the famous Fernsehturm, Brandenburg Gate at the end of the central boulevard Unter den Linden and more main tourist attractions of the city. For these reasons Mitte is considered the heart of Berlin. The history of Mitte corresponds to the history of the entire city until the early 20th century, and with the Greater Berlin Act in 1920 it became the first district of the city. It was among the areas of the city most heavily damaged in World War II. Following a territorial redeployment by the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom that reshaped the borders of West Berlin's British Sector in August 1945, the western part of Staaken became in effect as of 1 February 1951 an exclave of Mitte, then still a borough of East Berlin. This ended on 1 January 1961, when western Staaken was incorporated into then East German Falkensee, which had already been under its de facto administration since 1 June 1952. Between 1961 and 1990 Mitte, one of the most important boroughs of East Berlin but close to all three western sectors of the city, was almost surrounded by the Berlin Wall. One of the most important border crossings was Checkpoint Charlie, near Kreuzberg."

   "name": "Tiergarten",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Potsdamer Platz, Straße des 17. Juni. Tiergarten, which means animal garden in English, was originally a large hunting ground for the Electors of Brandenburg, but was developed into its current form as a park in the 1830’s. After the devastation of World War II, it was deforested and the wood was used for firewood for the city. Today, the park has been regrown and is known for its memorials for the victims of the Nazi era. Splitting the park in half is the street Straße des 17. Juni which from east to west starts at the Brandenburg Gate, passes the Victory Column (Siegessäule) and ends at the Charlottenburg Gate (Charlottenburger Tor). The locality was formerly within West Berlin, and is now the home of many parliamentary and government buildings including the offices of the German Chancellery and Bundestag. While in the past the area was undeveloped, in recent years several new apartment buildings have been built opening the way for new residents. Notable for the great and homonymous urban park, before German reunification, it was a part of West Berlin. Until Berlin's 2001 administrative reform, Tiergarten was also the name of a borough (Bezirk), consisting of the current locality (Ortsteil) of Tiergarten (formerly called Tiergarten-Süd) plus Hansaviertel and Moabit. A new system of road and rail tunnels runs under the park towards Berlin's main station in nearby Moabit. Once a hunting ground of the Electors of Brandenburg the Großer Tiergarten park of today was designed in the 1830s by landscape architect Peter Joseph Lenné. In the course of industrialization in the 19th century, a network of streets was laid out in the Hobrecht-Plan in an area that came to be known architecturally as the Wilhelmine Ring.[2] In 1894 the Reichstag building by architect Paul Wallot opened as the seat of the German parliament. The lawn between the contemporary Haus der Kulturen der Welt (House of World Cultures) and the Reichstag building was the site of the Krolloper opera house, built in 1844, which served as parliament house after the Reichstag fire on 27 February 1933 and was demolished by air raids in 1943. On 15 January 1919 the socialist Karl Liebknecht was shot by Freikorps soldiers within the park near the lake Neuer See. The corpse of Rosa Luxemburg, murdered on the same day, was found in the nearby Landwehrkanal on 1 June 1919. The first Institut für Sexualwissenschaft (Institute for Sex Research) of Magnus Hirschfeld was situated at the former In den Zelten street, near the contemporary Haus der Kulturen der Welt, from 1919 until it was closed by the Nazis in 1933. A site next to the Tiergarten park is the former location of a villa at Tiergartenstrasse 4 where more than 60 Nazi bureaucrats and doctors worked in secret under the T4 program to organize the mass murder of sanatorium and psychiatric hospital patients deemed unworthy to live.[4] The German national memorial to the people with disabilities systematically murdered by the Nazis was dedicated in 2014 in Berlin at that site.[5][4] As well, although the villa was destroyed, a plaque set in the pavement on Tiergartenstraße marks its location and historic significance. After 1944 the park was largely deforested, because it served as a source of firewood for the devastated city. In 1945, the Soviet Union built a war memorial along the Straße des 17. Juni, the Tiergarten's main east-west artery, near the Brandenburg Gate.The locality houses many parliamentary and governmental institutions, among others the Bundestag in the Reichstag building and the new German Chancellery. The residence of the German President, Schloss Bellevue and the Carillon are also located in the Tiergarten park. It contains several notable sculptures including the four-tiered Victory Column (Siegessäule), the Bismarck Memorial and several other memorials to prominent Prussian generals, all of which were located in the ceremonial park facing the Reichstag before they were moved to their present location by the Nazis. In addition, the tree-lined pedestrian avenues emanating from the Victory Column contain several ceremonial sculptures of Prussian aristocrats enacting an 18th-century hunt. The Brandenburg Gate and the Potsdamer Platz are situated on the eastern rim of the locality, the former frontier between East and West Berlin. Nearby is the Kulturforum stretching from the Berliner Philharmonie, a 1963 concert hall by architect Hans Scharoun and home of the Berlin Philharmonic orchestra to the Neue Nationalgalerie built by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in 1968. In between are the neoclassical Saint Matthew Church, built in 1845 by Friedrich August Stüler, the Gemäldegalerie as well as the new branch of the Berlin State Library (Staatsbibliothek). The adjacent area between the park and the Landwehrkanal is home to Emil Fahrenkamp's 1932 Shell-Haus, numerous embassies and the Bendlerblock, where in 1944 Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg and the conspirators of the 20 July plot were shot by a firing squad. Today the building serves as second office of the Federal Ministry of Defence. Nearby are the headquarters of the Christian Democratic Party, the Konrad Adenauer Foundation and Friedrich Ebert Foundation academies as well as the Bauhaus Archive and the high schools Französisches Gymnasium and Canisius-Kolleg. The adjacent western area at the border to Charlottenburg houses the Berlin Zoo. The 1985 album Le Parc by Tangerine Dream contains a track titled Tiergarten. At the Victory Column and the Straße des 17. Juni the Love parade from 1996-2003 and 2006 took place as well as the German Live 8 concert on 2 July 2005. Since 1987, the annual Berlin Marathon starts here. On 24 July 2008, Barack Obama spoke at the Victory Column in front of a crowd of over 200,000 people."

   "name": "Wedding",
   "description": "Central area: around Leopoldplatz. A farmstead and forest for much of its history, Wedding started to develop in the mid-1700’s as a pleasure district. With mass migration from rural areas to the city in 19th century, Wedding later became a working class district. During the interwar years, it was known for the violent clashes between Nazis and Communist groups. After World War II, Wedding was part of the French sector which later became West Berlin. Today Wedding is one of the poorest areas of Berlin with high unemployment rates. However, rents are also relatively low in comparison to other areas, although this is slowly beginning to change. It is an ethnically diverse area, with significant Turkish, Arab, African, and Asian communities. In the 12th century, the manor of the nobleman Rudolf de Weddinge was located on the small Panke River in the immediate vicinity of today's Nettelbeckplatz. The farmstead, which burned down more than once, remained abandoned in the forest until the 18th century. In the mid-18th century, while Gesundbrunnen was being built up as a health resort and spa town, gambling and prostitution moved into Wedding, transforming it into a pleasure district. In 1864, Ernst Christian Friedrich Schering established the Schering pharmaceutical company on Müllerstraße, the company has been a part of Bayer since 2006. A large hospital at the western rim of the locality was built between 1898 and 1906 on the initiative of Rudolf Virchow. The Rotaprint plant was initiated in Wedding in 1904 and became one of the largest employers locally with about 1,000 staff at its height. The constant migration of country-dwellers into the city at the end of the 19th century converted Wedding into a working-class district. The labourers lived in cramped tenement blocks, many in the Wilhelmine Ring. After World War I, Wedding was known as Red Wedding as it was renowned for its militant, largely Communist working class, it was the scene of violent clashes between Communist and Nazi sympathizers in the late 1920s. After World War II, Wedding and Reinickendorf together made up the French sector of Berlin. The buildings on the north side of Wedding's Bernauer Straße and the street, including sidewalks, were in the French sector, while the buildings along the southern side were in Soviet territory. When the Berlin Wall was being built in August 1961, many who lived in these buildings frantically jumped from their windows before the buildings could be evacuated and their windows bricked up. Wedding was also the western terminus of one of the first refugee tunnels dug underneath the Berlin wall. It extended from the basement of an abandoned factory on Schönholzer Straße in the Soviet sector underneath Bernauer Straße to another building in the west. Though marvellously well constructed and kept secret, the tunnel was plagued by water from leaking pipes, and had to be shut down after only a few days of operation. A section of the wall has been reconstructed near the spot on Bernauer Straße (since 2001 part of the locality of Gesundbrunnen) where the tunnel ended. Two sections of wall run parallel to one another down the street with a death strip in the middle. A nearby museum documents the history of the wall. Today, Wedding is one of the poorest areas of Berlin, with a high unemployment rate (almost 26%). Almost 17% of the population live on social welfare, 27% live below the poverty line.[3] Foreigners make up 30% of the population.[4] Low rental costs accompany the poverty in Wedding. Therefore, like many inexpensive areas in large cities, it is home to a vibrant artists' community. Many galleries have been founded by artists to provide a space for themselves and their peers to showcase their works. Wedding has so far not experienced the boom and development of the 1990s in Berlin. Unlike many other 19th-century working class districts like Prenzlauer Berg, the original character of Wedding has been mostly preserved. Recently, however, more and more students and artists have moved to Wedding due to lower rental costs and a fairly high level of quality of life. As a result, many new Bohemian cafés, restaurants and clubs, organic food stores and markets have been established, an art-house cinema and an urban gardening project has successfully started and high-brow galleries have discovered that area.[5][6][7][8] It is still said though to be a place to find the Schnauze mit Herz (big mouth and big heart) of the Berlin working class. Crime had become so bad in November 2016 that DHL Express stopped deliveries in the area due to muggings, extortion and robbery of their delivery staff. Along with Kreuzberg, Wedding is one of the most ethnically diverse localities of Berlin. The multicultural atmosphere is visible in the bilingual shop signs (predominantly German and Turkish or German and Arabic). In recent years Wedding has seen a significant influx of Africans, many of whom have settled in the Afrikanisches Viertel, or African Quarter. Wedding is also home to an East Asian community, mostly from China, which is reflected in many Asian and African stores and restaurants. As of 2011, the ethnic make-up of Wedding was 52% of German origin, 18% Turks, 6% Sub-Saharan African, 6% Arabs, 6% Polish, 5% former Yugoslavia, and 4.5% Asian. Many buildings are relics of European post-war Modernism. The Schillerpark estate in northern Wedding is part of the Modernist Housing Estates World Heritage Site. Beside monolithic housing blocks, several old buildings survived the war and urban renewal and still have coal-fired heating. A green oasis marks the west borders of the old red district, with Volkspark Rehberge, Goethepark and the idyllic Plötzensee, a lake in the southwest. It is a popular summer hang-out offering sandy beaches and long lawns. A section of the beach is reserved for Freikörperkultur, a German nudist movement. At Scharnweberstraße 158/159 is Germany's last inner-city dune dating back to Ice Age."

   "name": "Gesundbrunnen",
   "description": "Gesundbrunnen translates as health well and derives its name from a mineral spring discovered in the area in 1748. In its early years it was a popular location for health seekers, but later became a working class district and the home of the popular Berlin football club Hertha BSC. It became famous during the Soviet Era for the daring escapes of some East Germans after the wall was built. In addition, the border crossing at Bornholmer Straße station was the first to open allowing East Berliners to pass into the west.  Like its close neighbor Wedding, Gesundbrunnen also has higher statistics of poverty and unemployment. Near its centre is one of the larger parks of inner-city Berlin, Volkspark Humboldthain. In recent years, Gesundbrunnen has begun to become more gentrified as rents have increased throughout the inner-city. The locality adopted its name from a mineral spring first documented by chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf about 1748, later site of the Luisenbad spa, named after Queen Louise of Prussia. The area became a popular destination for day-trippers and, after its incorporation into the city of Berlin in 1861, a densely settled working-class district. From 1905 the sports field near the Berlin-Gesundbrunnen station, later Stadion am Gesundbrunnen, was the home ground of the Hertha BSC Berlin football club. The Humboldthain urban park, finished in 1876, from 1942 was the site of two large flak towers. The northern tower, due to its location near the Ringbahn tracks, was not blown up after World War II. Partly interred by rubble it today serves as a viewpoint and climbing wall with tours through the interior available. From 1949 Gesundbrunnen (as part of Wedding) belonged to the French sector of West Berlin, while the neighbouring localities of Mitte, Pankow and Prenzlauer Berg were parts of East Berlin. The border between the sectors and, from 1961 to 1989, the Berlin Wall ran along the Nordbahn railway and the divided Bernauer Straße. This street became famous for tunnels dug under it as well as for daring escape jumps from windows of the apartment blocks in the eastern part of the city, down to the street which itself belonged to the French sector. On the evening of November 9, 1989 the border crossing at Bornholmer Straße station was the first to open, allowing East Berliners to pass freely toward the west."

   "name": "Hansaviertel",
   "description": "For a period of time in the 15th century, the city of Berlin was a member of the Hanseatic League, a commercial and defensive coalition of allied city states. The locality takes its name from this coalition and its streets are named after the different Hanseatic cities of Germany. It is the smallest locality in Berlin and was almost completely destroyed during World War II. The area was redeveloped as a housing estate in the 1950’s by international architects and is now a protected historic monument.  The Hansaviertel was developed to be a self-contained community and is home to several churches, childcare facilities, a library, a theater, and a club. Among its highlights are the unique architectural style of the buildings, several interesting works of modern art and sculpture, and the residence of the German President, Schloß Bellevue. The Hansaviertel is the smallest Ortsteil (district) of Berlin and is between Großer Tiergarten and the Spree River, within the central Mitte borough of Berlin. It was almost completely destroyed during World War II but was rebuilt from 1957 to 1961 as a housing estate project by international master architects like Alvar Aalto, Egon Eiermann, Walter Gropius, Oscar Niemeyer, Sep Ruf. Called Interbau, the whole ensemble has two churches (St. Ansgar and Kaiser-Friedrich-Gedächtniskirche) and is now protected as a historic monument. The quarter received its name for its streets named after Hansa cities, with the Hansaplatz in the centre. This square contains a small shopping arcade, a library and the Grips-Theater. The Hansaplatz subway station was built in 1957, though the U9 line did not open before 1961. Some Gründerzeit buildings remained north of the Stadtbahn railway. The Altonaer Straße, named after Altona, leads to the Victory Column. Schloss Bellevue, the residence of the German President is nearby. Right beside the U-bahn train station is Hansaplatz square. Now a non-discernible traffic junction, this was an active plaza before the war. Led by Kolleg X students from the Bauhaus in Dessau, there is an active movement to reclaim this Plaza as a community space and share it with the cars and bicycles that currently dominate."

   "name": "Moabit",
   "description": "Moabit was originally a waste dumping area and part of the hunting grounds of the electors of Brandenburg. It remained sparsely populated throughout the 18th century and stayed this way until it was developed as an industrial suburb in the 19th century. Formerly a border district of West Berlin, since the fall of the wall Moabit has become central. In recent years there has been much new development, including the Federal Ministry of the Interior and the central station Berlin Hauptbahnhof. Near the Hauptbahnhof in the Berlin State Museums of Contemporary Art which is housed in the former Hamburger Bahnhof, one of the oldest railway stations in Germany.  Known for its large immigrant population and its prison, Moabit has only just recently begun to see signs of gentrification since the opening of the Hauptbahnhof. The district is split between the more affluent section south of park Kleiner Tierpark, and the poorer northern section. However, it remains an affordable area in central Berlin and is easily accessible by both U-Bahn and S-Bahn. Moabit is an inner city locality of Berlin. Since Berlin's 2001 administrative reform it belongs to the newly regrouped governmental borough of Mitte. Previously, from 1920 to 2001, it belonged to the borough of Tiergarten. Moabit's borders are defined by three watercourses: the Spree, the Westhafen Canal and the Berlin-Spandau Navigation Canal. Colloquially, the name Moabit also refers to the Central Criminal Court (Strafgericht) and detention centre, which deals with all criminal cases in Berlin. Moabit is an inner city locality of Berlin.

Moabit's borders are defined by three watercourses: the Spree, the Westhafen Canal and the Berlin-Spandau Navigation Canal. Colloquially, the name Moabit also refers to the Central Criminal Court (Strafgericht) and detention centre, which deals with all criminal cases in Berlin. In the 13th century the waste area along the road to Spandau known as Grosse Stadtheide (Great city Heath) was a hunting ground of the electors of Brandenburg. 1716 saw the formation of the colony of Old Moabit by the Huguenots, who were meant to cultivate white mulberry trees for silkworms, but failed because of the low soil quality. In 1818 New Moabit was founded and grew together with Old Moabit to an industrial suburb district, which was incorporated into the city of Berlin in 1861. The industrialization started in 1820 when, with the financial support of court counsellor Baillif, a simple bridge was built to connect the island to the Berlin mainland. The bridge was followed by factories, a power plant, the Berlin-Spandau Canal, the Westhafen port and the Hamburger Bahnhof train station. A network of streets was laid out in the Hobrecht-Plan in an area that came to be known architecturally as the Wilhelmine Ring. All this activity resulted in an exponential growth of the population, facilitating the spread of a smallpox epidemic. In consequence, Berlin's city council, exhorted by Rudolf Virchow built a second hospital (after the Charité), the Krankenhaus Moabit in 1872. In the 1880s, Robert Koch worked here on the sterilization of surgical instruments and the isolation of the tuberculosis bacterium. A teaching hospital from 1920 on, the Krankenhaus Moabit employed notable physicians like the Nobel Laureate Werner Forssmann, Lydia Rabinowitsch-Kempner and the resistance fighter Georg Groscurth. The facility was finally closed in 2001.The origin of the name Moabit is disputed. According to one account, it can be traced back to the Huguenots, in the time of King Frederick William I of Prussia. These French refugees are said to have named their new residence in reference to the Biblical description of the Israelites in the country of Moab, where they stayed before being allowed to enter Canaan. Other possible origins include the German (Berlin dialect) Moorjebiet (swamp area). A first prison, the Zellengefängnis (Cell Prison) on Lehrter Strasse was built between 1842 and 1849 by order of King Frederick William IV of Prussia, according to the separate system of Pentonville Prison. In 1878 Max Hödel, who had shot at Emperor Wilhelm I of Germany, was beheaded here. Political activists like Karl Radek, Erich Mühsam and Musa Cälil were detained in Moabit. Wilhelm Voigt, the Hauptmann von Köpenick, and the writer Wolfgang Borchert served their prison sentences in the prison. On 11 April 1928, during the Weimar Republic, the 20-year-old Communist activist Olga Benário and several of her comrades managed to break into the prison and free the incarcerated Otto Li De Braun, a prominent party member and at the time Benario's lover. Despite being hotly hunted, the two lovers succeeded in escaping to Moscow and later rose (separately) to prominence in the International Communist movement (in Brazil and China respectively). After the July 20 plot it was used as a detention centre by the Gestapo, which on the night of 22 April 1945, murdered 16 inmates, among them Klaus Bonhoeffer, Rüdiger Schleicher and Albrecht Haushofer, who wrote the Moabit Sonnets during his detention. After the war, the prison in its last years housed some Nazi war criminals, such as Erich Bauer, who had operated the gas chambers in the Sobibor extermination camp. The prison was closed in 1955 and demolished, though its walls can still be seen north of the Hauptbahnhof enclosing a remembrance park laid out in 2006. The vast building of the Criminal Court on Turmstraße was erected in 1906. In 1909, architect Peter Behrens built the AEG's Turbine factory at the north-western Huttenstraße, one of the first works of Modern architecture.  Large parts of Moabit are traditional working-class residential areas. Some areas were known for their political activity during the Nazi era, such as the red Beusselkiez or the neighbouring Rostock Kiez. After the Nazi Machtergreifung in 1933 they were considered Communist resistance cells. With the fall of the Berlin Wall, Moabit's location has changed from a border district of West Berlin to a central district in the reunited city. Due to its proximity to the new Government District, many new buildings have been built there, such as for example the Federal Ministry of the Interior Bundesministerium des Innern. Near the border to Mitte the former S-Bahn station Lehrter Stadtbahnhof was demolished to make space for the new central station Berlin Hauptbahnhof, Europe's largest two level railway station, where the east-west and the north-south railway axis meet. Nearby is one of Germany's oldest railway station buildings, the neoclassical Hamburger Bahnhof, built in 1847, which was closed in 1884 and since 1996 houses one of the Berlin State Museums for contemporary art. Moabit is mentioned in countless books and films taking place in Germany or Berlin, primarily in reference to criminal court cases or incarcerations at the Central Criminal Court (Kriminalgericht) and detention centre. The Berlin-based band No Nebraska! released a song entitled Moabit is an Island on their EP Serves Six in 2007."

   "name": "Prenzlauer Berg",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Kollwitzplatz, Kulturbrauerei, Prater Beer Garden, Mauerpark. Prior to the 19th century, the area that would become Prenzlauer Berg was just a few fields and wind mills. Like many of the surrounding districts, the layout of Prenzlauer Berg was defined by the binding-plan of urban design of the Hobrecht-Plan and was part of the Wilhelmine Ring. The results of which was a community of multi-occupancy housing blocks on wide avenues with large urban parks and a modern sewer system. The locality became known for its specific style of tenement houses and was highly overpopulated at the turn of the century. Later in the century the Nazis used several buildings in the area to torture political opponents including the historic water tower (Wasserturm Prenzlauer Berg). While the area was significantly damaged during the war, only 10% of buildings were considered completely destroyed and 72% of buildings were only slightly damaged or intact which is considerably less than other areas of the city such as Mitte and Tiergarten which had a 50% loss of buildings. Due to this relative low amount of damage, the area retains much of the architectural charm of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Prenzlauer Berg was part of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and became a popular location for artists, students, and the gay community. Following the reunification of Germany, many of the buildings which had been state owned were sold to private investors leading to significant gentrification. Prenzlauer Berg is the most densely populated locality in the city. An area severely affected by gentrification, since the reunification in the early nineties it has transformed from a working-class neighborhood to one of the most expensive and sought-after areas in the city and the community is largely made up of young urban professionals. It is characterized by tree-lined avenues, classic architecture, young families, and trendy restaurants, cafes, and bars. Kastanienallee is a popular location for its nightlife and Greifenhagener Straße is known to be the place of East Berlin's vibrant gay scene. From its founding in 1920 until 2001, Prenzlauer Berg was a district of Berlin in its own right. However, that year it was incorporated (along with the borough of Weißensee) into the greater district of Pankow. From the 1960s onward, Prenzlauer Berg was associated with proponents of East Germany's diverse counterculture including Christian activists, bohemians, state-independent artists, and the gay community. It was an important site for the peaceful revolution that brought down the Berlin Wall in 1989. In the 1990s the borough was also home to a vibrant squatting scene. It has since experienced rapid gentrification.Prenzlauer Berg is characterized by Wilhelmine buildings, that were erected at the turn of the 20th century (1889 to 1905). Over 80% of all housing in this area was constructed before 1948, with the oldest building still standing being from 1848 at 77 Kastanienallee. Though substantial, there was less war-related destruction here than in other parts of the city, which were almost entirely wiped out by the allied bombing campaign. Apart from the apartment buildings in the area around Ostseestraße built in the 1950s, characterized by the architectural style of Socialist Classicism, the borough was mostly left alone by Socialist city planners until the 1980s when prestigious high rise buildings were built in Ernst-Thälmann-Park. At the time of German Reunification the borough's residential areas were characterized by dilapidated grey facades that had not seen a coat of paint since the 1930s. In the 1990s the buildings who belonged to state-owned housing associations were sold to private investors who had them renovated and raised the rents. Most of the borough's original inhabitants were not able to afford the increased costs and have since moved away. In the 21st century the many empty lots that were sites for the street culture integral to the bohemian character of the borough were filled by high-class condominiums. Today, Prenzlauer Berg forms a nearly homogeneous historic building area. Over 300 buildings remain protected as historic monuments, like the municipal swimming pool at Oderberger Straße and the breweries on Milastraße and Knaackstraße. The borough is famous for its restaurants and bars. Although places that provide a truly traditional Berlin staple are few and far between, there is a vast array of restaurants offering Arab, Turkish, Vietnamese, Tex-Mex, and Italian cuisine, especially around Kastanienalle, Kollwitzplatz, and Helmholtzplatz. The nightlife concentrates around the U-Bahn station Eberswalder Straße. The area around the intersections of Schönhauser Allee, Danziger Straße, Eberswalder Straße, Kastanienallee and Pappelallee has been associated with youth culture since the 1950s and was immortalised in the DEFA film Ecke Schönhauser. With regard to urban planning, the district affords a relatively uniform picture. It is predominantly characterized by five-story, multiple dwelling units in closed blocks. Thanks to the long property lots, the blocks, more often than not, are very large and have abundant backyards, some having a perimeter of more than a kilometer. Notable buildings are the large churches of the district, of which Gethsemane Church (designed by August Orth and built in 1891-1893) at Stargarder Straße is best known for its role in the peaceful revolution that brought down the Wall in 1989. Its 66-meter steeple is surpassed by that of Segenskirche on Schönhauser Allee (79 meters) and of Immanuelkirche on Prenzlauer Allee (68 meters). The representative school buildings, planned by Ludwig Ernst Emil Hoffmann (1852–1932), also stand out in the area. The largest synagogue in Germany is that on Rykestraße. Construction began at the end of 1903 and it was dedicated on 4 September 1904. During the Third Reich the building escaped the antisemitic November pogrom in 1938, for the synagogue was tightly surrounded by residential buildings. The synagogue was desecrated and confiscated in April 1940. In July 1945 it reopened for services, underwent several renovations (1952/1953, 1976, 1987/1988) and on the occasion of its 100th anniversary it was restored to its original splendor. In the Jewish Cemetery on Schönhauser Allee, opened in 1827, there are more than 22,500 graves and 750 family tombs, including the graves of David Friedländer, Max Liebermann, Leopold Ullstein, Ludwig Bamberger, Eduard Lasker and Giacomo Meyerbeer. A landmark in Prenzlauer Berg is the former water tower Fat Hermann at Rykestraße corner of Knaackstraße from the year 1877, which was the first water tower in Berlin. Another remarkable building is the Zeiss-Großplanetarium on Prenzlauer Allee, opened in 1987. In the west, bordering the borough of Wedding, adjacent to Friedrich Ludwig Jahn Sportpark, is a stretch public green area that goes by the name of Mauerpark (Wall park). It consists of the former border zone, or death strip between both walls that separated East- and West Berlin. Before the war, the terrain was a site of a freight station. After reunification the area was turned into a public park, which is home to a weekly flea market and open air concerts. It attracts thousands of visitors on summer weekends.

It attracts thousands of visitors on summer weekends.Prenzlauer Berg was developed during the second half of the 19th century based on an urban planning design from 1862 by James Hobrecht, the so-called Hobrecht-Plan for Berlin. Prenzlauer Berg was part of what became known as the Wilhelmine Ring with a primarily working-class population. In Nazi Germany (1933-1945) landmark buildings such as the water tower at Rykestraße and the office buildings at Froebelstraße were used as makeshift concentration camps and torture chambers. During the war years the city population decreased as many inhabitants were evacuated to the countryside to escape aerial bombardment. When the city was divided by the allies, Prenzlauer Berg became part of the Soviet Sector and from 1947 onward part of the capital of the German Democratic Republic. From the 1960s onward, the borough's tenement houses (in German: Mietskasernen) were home to intellectuals, artists, students, and East Germany's gay community. In the interim between the peaceful revolution that brought down the wall in 1989 and the consolidation of a united Germany that began a year later, as many as 39 Wilhelmine apartment houses were squatted in Prenzlauer Berg alone.[2] Focal points were the areas around Kastanienallee, Teutoburger Platz and Helmholtzplatz (locally known as LSD-Borough for the initials of its three main thoroughfares Lychener- Schliemann- and Dunckerstraße). The first ones to move in were young grassroots activists from Prenzlauer Berg in search of radical democratic alternatives to the state-socialism of the GDR. They were soon joined by young anarchists from West-Berlin and other parts of Germany and set up countless collective projects ranging from bicycle workshops to community soup kitchens.[3] Some of the squats contributed to the cultural life of the borough as they were venues for concerts, poetry slams, and underground movie screenings. They frequently came under attack by neonazi skinheads and football hooligans. While many squats were cleared out by the police by 1998, some inhabitants entered into contracts with the city and were able to stay on. Most of Prenzlauer Berg's urban apartment blocks had belonged to the state-owned housing associations of the GDR. After reunification they entered into a massive privatization scheme and were bought up by private investors who raised the rents. This has led to many original residents who were no longer able to afford the elevated living expenses being replaced by more affluent newcomers. Historic buildings like Wasserturm (water tower), near Kollwitzplatz, or the Prater Beer Garden in Kastanienallee, as well as the former brewery in Schönhauser Allee/Sredzkystraße still give an impression of the days when Prenzlauer Berg was part of so-called Steinernes Berlin (Berlin of stone) as described by author Werner Hegemann in 1930. Countless pubs, restaurants, cafés, galleries and little shops create a day and nightlife atmosphere unique from the rest of Berlin. Along with Schöneberg, Neukölln and Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg is a focal point of the Berlin art scene. Along with Friedrichshain, Neukölln and Kreuzberg it is also a popular neighbourhood with the student population, however, in recent years, the gentrification that paralleled the borough's rise in popularity resulted in an exodus of students to cheaper neighborhoods. 2007 German journalist Henning Sußebach coined the term Bionade-Biedermeier, a neologism combining the name of a popular organic softdrink with the Biedermeier era (1815-1848) to describe the sociocultural situation of Prenzlauer Berg.[5] The term is equivalent to e.g. LOHAS and Bobo (Bohémiens bourgeoises). Prenzlauer Berg is popular with tourists for its picturesque streets, its nightlife and its central location. Unlike other parts of Berlin, it retains much of its prewar architecture and is still replete with cobble-stoned streets and ornate buildings from the beginning of the 20th century. Many areas of Prenzlauer Berg have become trendy shopping areas with streetstyle fashion designers selling their wares in its boutiques. Prenzlauer Berg has also become famous for being one of the few places in Germany that have experienced a baby boom since the mid 1990s. This is due to the above-average presence of people between 20 and 40 rather than a higher birthrate than elsewhere in the country. The borough has adapted to the trend offering an abundance of playgrounds, daycare centers, as well as (second-hand) shops and cafes catering to the needs of young children and their parents. Since the late 1990s Prenzlauer Berg has become popular for more affluent people from Southern Germany who have bought condominiums here. More recently, countless North American, British, Scandinavian, Australian and Spanish citizens have moved into the borough attracted by the relatively cheap cost of accommodation and studio space compared to other cultural capitals like New York, London, and Paris. Over the years many artists chose Prenzlauer Berg as their residence: the painter and sculptor Käthe Kollwitz, the early film maker Max Skladanowsky, the poets Adolf Endler, Annemarie Bostroem, and Heinz Kahlau, the theater director Christoph Schlingensief, the writers Jurek Becker, Bruno Apitz, Peter Hacks, Herbert Nachbar, Dieter Noll, Klaus Schlesinger, Klaus Kordon, Uwe Kolbe, Paul Alfred Kleinert, Florian Illies, Wladimir Kaminer, and Detlef Opitz, the sculptor Olaf Nicolai, the painters Cornelia Schleime, Elke Pollack, and Konrad Knebel, the photographer Helga Paris, the film director Tom Tykwer, the playwright René Pollesch, the musicians Gerhard Schöne, Christian Lillinger, Nina Hagen, Dirk von Lowtzow (Tocotronic) and Till Lindemann, (Rammstein), the actors Fredy Sieg, Eva-Maria Hagen, Heike Makatsch, Katharina Wackernagel, David Bennent, Daniel Brühl, August Diehl, Kurt Krömer and Matthias Schweighöfer, the comic-strip artist Flix, as well as the TV- and radio presenters Hans Rosenthal, Alfred Biolek, Sarah Kuttner, Sandra Maischberger and Benjamin Tewaag."

   "name": "Weissensee",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Weißensee, Park am Weißensee, Milchhäuschen, Brotfabrik. Weißensee, which translates as White Lake and derives its name from the lake of the same name, was founded around 1230 on a medieval trade route. It was first mentioned in 1313 as Wittense. The early settlers subsisted on fishing and trading on the nearby route which went between Berlin and Szczecin (Stettin) and the Baltic Sea. Around 1540 a manor was established in the area, but it frequently changed ownership. During the Thirty Years War (1618 – 1648) the village was repeatedly occupied by Swedish troops and the population was devastated, but it quickly recovered. In the late 19th century, the population expanded greatly as the area was developed due to the expanding population of Berlin. Following World War II, Weißensee was a part of East Berlin.Weißensee is a green and spacious urban-residential district. It is one of the least densely populated areas of Berlin, although it's beginning to become more popular due to the convenient public transport into the city centre and its proximity to the popular neighborhood of Prenzlauer Berg. Until recently, the area has largely been ignored by developers and investors making it a relatively inexpensive option which retains the charm of Berlin before its rise in popularity. The locality has five different quarters: the Gründerviertel to the west is mostly commercial and industrial buildings, the Komponistenviertel to the south is mostly apartment blocks of both new and old styles, Alt-Weißensee at Berliner Allee is in the centre of the locality and where shopping can be found, the Munizipalviertel in the central-west has architecturally significant apartments from the 1910's, and the Taut-Siedlung which is an inexpensive apartment block. Weißensee was first mentioned in 1313 as Wittense. The first settlers subsisted on fishing and established themselves on the eastern shore of the lake, where an old trade route connected Berlin with Szczecin (Stettin) and the Baltic Sea - today the Bundesstraße 2 federal highway. As Berlin's least inhabited district, it has been overshadowed historically by its neighboring boroughs Prenzlauer Berg and Pankow. However its popularity is increasing due to its proximity to the hip but expensive Prenzlauer Berg. Its trams make reaching Mitte very convenient. Weißensee is appreciated as a good choice for people seeking for a balance between urban life and seclusion in a peaceful district of Berlin. The immediate area around the lake Weißer See is characterized by its historical architecture, numerous places of interest, parks, lakes and activities. The art school Kunsthochschule Berlin-Weißensee is of national rank. The Radrennbahn Weißensee cycling track has also hosted popular music concerts. The largest concert ever held here was a Bruce Springsteen concert on July 19, 1988. Springsteen played before an estimated crowd of 300,000. At Weißensee Cemetery, one of Europe's largest Jewish cemeteries, notable people like the painter Lesser Ury and the publishers Samuel Fischer and Rudolf Mosse are buried."

   "name": "Blankenburg",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Dorfkirche Blankenburg, Alt-Blankenburg. Like many of the villages around Berlin, Blankenburg was founded in the early 13th century during the eastward expansion (Ostsiedlung) of settlers from the south western areas of Germany. The village church (Dorfkirche Blankenburg) was built in 1250 and it still exists to this day. In Alt-Blankenburg, the village still retains many old buildings and the classic village design of houses built around a central church and green park. Today, Blankenburg is a quiet, developed suburb with is mostly made up of single-family homes. It has some of the lowest rental prices in Berlin, but it is far removed from the nightlife opportunities available in inner-city localities. That being said, the S-Bahn connection is highly reliable, and it takes only 20 minutes to reach the city centre. The locality, first mentioned in 1375,[1] was an autonomous municipality of the former Niederbarnim district, merged into Berlin in 1920 with the Greater Berlin Act."

   "name": "Heinersdorf",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Dorfkirche Heinersdorf, Altes Spritzenhaus, Wasserturm Heinersdorf. Heinersdorf was first mentioned in 1319 when it was sold by the Margrave of Brandenburg to the Hospital of the Holy Ghost in Berlin, but it was likely founded much earlier, around 1230. After the initial sale, the village changed owners several times. The church foundations were laid around 1300 and there are two stained glass windows by Charles Crodel from 1946. With the construction of the railway line in 1900 to the city of Bernau, the locality of Heinersdorf began to grow with modern single-family home settlements built. Like many of the surrounding localities, Heinersdorf is a suburban community with inexpensive rents. Much of the area to the south and north are communities of private garden allotments (Kleingartenanlagen). It is also the home of the Khadija Moschee, the first mosque in Eastern Germany. It was first mentioned in a 1319 document when it was sold by Margrave Waldemar of Brandenburg to the Hospital of the Holy Ghost in Berlin. After that it changed its owner several times. In 1920 it was incorporated into Greater Berlin and belonged to the former Pankow borough, until in 1985 it was merged with Karow, Blankenburg and Weissensee. These localities belong to Pankow again after Berlin's 2001 administrative reform. The foundations of the fieldstone church were laid about 1300. It features two stained glass windows by Charles Crodel from 1946. Another landmark is the Heinersdorf water tower, which was erected in 1910. Original part of a planned town hall that has never been built, it later served as a Flak tower and as a listening station of the Red Army. Since 1991 the building is abandoned. Nowadays Heinerdorf is often in the media due to a controversy on the establishment of the Khadija Mosque by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community."

   "name": "Karow",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Alt-Karow, Dorfkirche Karow, Karower Teiche. Founded in the early 13th century, Karow was first documented as Kare in 1244, although it is uncertain where the name originates. The village church was built around 1250 and it still exists along with several farmhouses from the 19th century. Karow was a rural farming community for much of its history before being lightly developed in the late 19th century. The northern part of the locality was used as a sewage farm for Berlin. With the creation of the train line between Bernau and Berlin, Karow became a more popular location and the population raised significantly in the 1920’s and 1930’s, almost exclusively as small settlement houses created for partial sustainability. The northwest area of Karow, where once there was a sewage farm, is now a nature reserve. The area is one of the more densely settled areas of northern Pankow district, but is still comprised of primarily single-family homes, though there are some apartment blocks in the eastern part of the locality. Like neighboring areas in northern Pankow, Karow is an inexpensive suburban community without many nightlife options, but easily accessible to the city centre. The S-Bahn station of Karow is as well the starting point of the Heidekrautbahn RB 27 (Heather flower line) which takes commuters and Berliners seeking recreation out of town to many place in Northern Brandenburg like Wandlitz, Groß Schönebeck and Schmachtenhagen. The locality was first mentioned in 1375 with the name of Kare. Autonomous Prussian municipality of the former Niederbarnim district, Karow was incorporated into Berlin in 1920, with the Greater Berlin Act. Located in the north-eastern suburb of Berlin, it borders with the localities of Buch, Französisch Buchholz, Blankenburg and Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow. It also borders, on the east, with the Brandenburger town of Ahrensfelde, in the district of Barnim. Part of its territory, close to the natural reserve Karower Teiche (in Buchholz) is included in Barnim Nature Park."

   "name": "Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Golf Resort Berlin Pankow. Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow is a small hamlet which used to belong to the rural community of Malchow. In the 1930’s the area was lightly developed and the northern part was used as a sewage farm, approximately a kilometre southwest of the village of Alt-Malchow. Here the streets and places are named after Norse mythology. Most of the locality consists of farmland and private garden allotments (Kleingartenanlagen) with only a small southern section populated by single-family homes. The community borders the industrial northern area of the locality of Weißensee. It is not easily accessible with public transport. The history of this locality is related to the neighboring quarter of Malchow. Originally the Siedlung was a civil parish of it, and Malchow an autonomous Prussian municipality of Brandenburg. In 1920 they were merged into Berlin by the Greater Berlin Act. From 1936 to 1939 the northern area of the locality was used as a sewage farm."

   "name": "Pankow",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Rathaus Pankow, Barockes Kavaliershaus, Alte Pfarrkirche Pankow. Named for the Panke River which flows at the edge of the locality, Pankow was founded in the early 13th century. It was a small village until the early 19th century during an urban boom. Traces of the original village can be found on Breiten Straße where the original village green with connected church remains. In the late 19th century, Pankow became a popular destination for Berliners to spend their summer months. During the partition of Berlin, Pankow was in the Soviet sector. It was an important district due to the nearby Schönhausen Palace being the residency of the president of East Germany. Pankow is an urban-residential community which is primarily made up of apartment buildings. As it is still relatively inexpensive compared to nearby districts and well-connected to multiple public transport routes, it is an up-and-coming area which has seen rental price increases and minor gentrification in recent years. The area of Breite Straße lies the centre of the old village of Pankow and continues to be a highlight of the area. The village of Pankow is named after the small Panke river, a tributary of the Spree. The settlement was first mentioned in a 1311 deed by the Margraves of Brandenburg, though the Four Evangelists fieldstone church had already been erected about 1230. In 1691 Elector Frederick III acquired Schönhausen Palace, in neighboring Niederschönhausen, from the heirs of General Joachim Ernst von Grumbkow, which promoted the development of the Pankow village. As Pankow grew, due to industrialization, in the 19th century, it became a suburb – and popular day-trip destination – of Berlin. It was finally incorporated into the city by the Greater Berlin Act of 1920. In the East German period, from 1949 to 1990, Pankow, together with Niederschönhausen, was a prominent quarter of East Berlin. From 1949 to 1960 Schönhausen Palace was the presidential residency of East Germany, and throughout the period many embassies were located in the vicinity."

   "description": "Remarkable Places: Dorfkirche Blankenfelde, Botanische Anlage Blankenfelde. Before Blankenfelde was settled during the eastward expansion (Ostsiedlung) in the early 13th century, it was the sight of an old Slavic settlement. Like much of the surrounding area, it was greatly affected by the Thirty Years War, but soon recovered as a small rural community. In the late 19th century, the area was used as a sewage farm for the city of Berlin. During World War II it was the location of two camps for forced labourers. And for much of the Soviet occupation and GDR it was the location of an immigrant and returnee reception centre. Blankenfelde is a rural community with single-family homes. Much of the locality consists of farm fields and only the central area is densely populated. It borders the neighboring state of Brandenburg to its north and is not easily accessible with public transport beyond one bus line, the 107. Blankenfelde was founded around 1375 and was integrated into Berlin in 1920 via the Greater Berlin Act. After World War II, it was part of East Berlin from 1949 to 1990. From 1961 to 1989, its western borders were part of the Berlin Wall. Located in the northern outskirts of the city, Blankenfelde borders on the Brandenburg municipalities of Mühlenbecker Land in the Oberhavel district and Wandlitz in the district of Barnim. Within Berlin, its neighboring localities are Buch, Französisch Buchholz, and Rosenthal in the borough of Pankow and Lübars in the Reinickendorf borough. Blankenfelde's largest lake is the Arkenberger Baggersee, located in a rural part of the Barnim Nature Park."

   "name": "Buch",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Schlosspark Buch, Schlosskirche Buch. While the village of Buch was founded in 1347 on the Panke River, the area has a long history of settlement ranging back as far as the Stone Age. The name Buch is a result of some of this history, for the area was settled by Slavic tribes long before the German settlers came during the eastward expansion (Ostsiedlung). While Buch now seems to mean book in modern German, it actually is derived from the Slavic Polabian word for a beech tree (buk). Buch was the location of several medical facilities which were built in the late 19th century and led to the village developing into a sizeable town. In the aftermath of World War I, housing communities were built to accommodate the increased demand. While many of the surrounding villages have retained their small village charm, Buch was greatly altered in the 1970’s with the building of many apartment blocks.  Today, Buch is a thriving community which is continuing to grow. There are many apartment blocks and some single-family homes in the southeast, the rest of the locality is farmland and forest. Buch is one of the least-expensive areas to rent in the city of Berlin and has an easy connection to the centre of the city with the S-Bahn. It is a rural and quiet community with easy access to natural beauty within the locality and in the neighbouring state of Brandenburg. Situated on the Panke river, it is the city's northernmost quarter, chiefly known for its historic village centre and extended hospital premises. The settlement area is located on the Barnim Plateau stretching in the northeast of the Berlin city centre up to the Oder–Havel Canal and the Oderbruch delta. Berlin's northernmost point is at the Rieselfelder meadows, a former sewage farm transformed in a rural area, part of the Buch Forest within the Barnim Nature Park [1]). The landscape is marked by hill chains, sandurs and small lakes such as the Bogensee. Along its border with the state of Brandenburg, Buch is surrounded by the municipalities of Wandlitz and Panketal (with the civil parishes of Zepernick, Röntgental and Neu Buch[2]), both in the district of Barnim. The Berlin localities bordering with Buch in the south are Blankenfelde, Französisch Buchholz and Karow. In Karow, a neighbourhood exists which is named Stadtrandsiedlung Buch. The quarter is centred around Berlin-Buch station on the Berlin–Szczecin railway line and the adjacent historic village centre in the east. An extended Plattenbau housing area stretches along the railway in the south, around the centre, several large hospital and sanatorium areas were laid out in the early 19th century, built according to plans designed by Ludwig Hoffmann, with retirement homes, psychiatric institutions, and a cemetery. Many of the premises have been converted to residential areas. The Barnim Plateau was already settled in the Mesolithic era. The village of Wendeschen Buk (Wendish, i.e. Slavic Buch) was first mentioned in a 1342 deed, it is also documented as Buch slavica in the 1375 register of Emperor Chales IV. Probably founded by Sprevane tribes, Buch gradually became a German village during the Ostsiedlung migration, instigated by the Ascanian margraves John I and Otto III of Brandenburg from the early 13th century onwards. The linear settlement around the village church and Buch manor, parallel to the Panke river with a watermill. The Slavic affix fell into disuse during the 16th century. Devastated during the Thirty Years' War, the Buch area was quickly redeveloped under the rule of the Great Elector Frederick William. The manor became am aristocratic estate, which about 1700 was inherited by the later adventurer and writer Baron Karl Ludwig von Pöllnitz (1692–1775). In the 18th century, the manor house and the church were rebuilt in a Baroque style. In the Seven Years' War, the premises were plundered by Russian troops under General Gottlieb Heinrich Totleben during his Raid on Berlin in 1760. After the war, King Frederick the Great promoted sericulture for a recovery of the local economy. Then held by the Voss noble family, the fate of Julie von Voss (1766–1789), lady-in-waiting and spouse of King Frederick William II of Prussia, was perpetuated in the Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg by Theodor Fontane. In 1815 Buch was incorporated into the newly established Prussian Province of Brandenburg. The station on the Berlin–Stettin railway line was inaugurated on 26 June 1879. The manor estates were purchased from the Voss family by the City of Berlin in 1898, in order to lay out the Rieselfelder sewage area according to plans by James Hobrecht. At the same time, it became the site of several municipal hospitals designed by Ludwig Hoffmann and Martin Wagner. Buch remained a Brandenburg municipality until 1920, when it merged into Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act. The hospital area from 1928 hosted the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research led by neurologists Oskar Vogt, Cécile Vogt-Mugnier and biologist Nikolay Timofeev-Ressovsky, from 1931 it had its seat in a newly erected building designed by Carl Sattler. During the Nazi era, headed by Hugo Spatz and Julius Hallervorden from 1937/38, it played a vital role in eugenics and racist research, and also in the Aktion T4 euthanasia program. From 1949 to 1990 Buch was part of East Berlin."

   "name": "Französisch Buchholz",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Dorfkirche Französisch Buchholz, Kossätenhof in Französisch Buchholz. Likely founded in the early 13th century, Französisch Buchholz was first documented in 1242. In 1670 the area became the possession of the Elector Friedrich Wilhelm. After the Thirty Years War, the area’s population and the infrastructure was devastated and as a result of the Edict of Potsdam in 1685 the town was turned into a French Colony by the settlement of the Huguenots. These French farmers brought with them many plants which were previously unknown in the area such as cauliflower, asparagus, artichokes, and various herbs and fruit trees. Around 1750 the area became known as Französisch Buchholz and became a popular excursion location for Berliners. During World War I, due to anti-French sentiment, the area was renamed Berlin-Buchholz and it was only in the late 1990’s that the original name was returned. Französisch Buchholz is a small rural community with private garden allotments (Kleingartenanlagen) and single-family homes. Along Rosenthaler Weg there are some modern apartment buildings. It is easily accessible by car as the motorway A114 is at its eastern border. Public transport options, however, are limited as it is only serviced by the tram and bus lines. Due to its relative remoteness from the inner city, rental prices in Französisch Buchholz are lower than the Berlin average. First mentioned in 1242 as Buckholtz in a document, it became the property of Frederick William I in 1670. In 1685, after the Edict of Potsdam, it was formed as a French colony (Französische Kolonie), a residence for French Huguenots. An autonomous municipality of Brandenburg, named Berlin-Buchholz after 1913, it was merged into Berlin in 1920 by the Greater Berlin Act. From 1949 to 1990 it was part of East Berlin."

   "name": "Niederschönhausen",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Schönhausen Palace, Friedenskirche, Schlosspark, Sowjetisches Ehrenmal (Schönholzer Heide). Another of the many villages around Berlin founded during the eastward expansion (Ostsiedlung) of the 13th century, Niederschönhausen differs from its neighbors due to the attention it received from Prussian royalty. Estates were purchased by the Elector Frederick III (later Frederick I, King of Prussia) and he built a manor house in the Baroque style as a Hohenzollern residence. His consort Elisabeth Christine lived there until her death in 1797. In the early 20th century, former grounds of the palace became known for its mansions. As the palace and surrounding area was only lightly damaged during World War II, Schönhausen Palace became the seat of the East German President from 1949 and later, a guest house of the East German government. It was also the location of the Two Plus Four Agreement (Zwei-plus-Vier-Vertrag) which paved the way for German reunification. Now, the adjacent premises are the home of the German Federal Academy for Security Policy and the palace has been restored to its original Baroque condition and is one of the few Berlin palaces to have survived the war unscathed. Niederschönhausen is a green locality with many parks to the south as well as some private garden allotments (Kleingartenanlagen). There is a mix between mansions, new and old apartment blocks, and single-family homes. Rental prices are mixed depending on the type of residence, but apartments tend to be lower than the Berlin average. Public transport is limited to tram and bus services, though S-Bahn stops are nearby in bordering localities of Reinickendorf and Heinersdorf. Located north of the Berlin city centre, Niederschönhausen borders with the localities of Wilhelmsruh, Rosenthal in the north, Französisch Buchholz in the east, Pankow in the south and the Reinickendorf locality (in the homonymous borough) along the Berlin Northern Railway line in the west. The locality comprises several green areas, as the Schönholzer Heide, the Brosepark, the Schlosspark Pankow,[1] the Bürgerpark and the cemetery Friedhof Pankow III. A settlement called Schonenhusen inferior or Nydderen Schonhusen was, like many others in the Margraviate of Brandenburg, first mentioned in the 1375 doomsday book (Landbuch) of Emperor Charles IV. The linear village was probably founded about 1230 by German colonists in the course of the medieval Ostsiedlung migration. The estates were purchased by the Elector Frederick III (King in Prussia as Frederick I from 1701), who had the local manor house rebuilt in a Baroque style as a Hohenzollern residence. In 1740 the new king Frederick the Great left Schönhausen Castle (Schloß Schönhausen) to his consort Elisabeth Christine who lived here until her death in 1797. The residential area that arose after nearby Berlin had become the German capital is characterised by mansions and dwelling houses, developed primarily around the year 1910 on the former estates of Schönhausen Palace.[2] This short-lived municipality of the former Niederbarnim district merged into Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act in 1920. Part of East Berlin during the Cold War, Schönhausen Place from 1949 served as the seat of East German President Wilhelm Pieck and later as a guest house of the East German government. Johannes R. Becher and several East German government officials resided in the secluded Majakowskiring quarter, until they moved to Wandlitz in 1960. From 1961 to 1989 the western boundary of Niederschönhausen with Reinickendorf (in West Berlin) was part of the Berlin Wall. In June 1990 Schönhausen Palace was a site of the Two Plus Four talks that paved the way for German reunification. Today the adjacent premises house the German Federal Academy for Security Policy. The palace has been restored in its original Baroque condition and since 2009 is open to the public."

   "name": "Rosenthal",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Dorfkirche Rosenthal, Gutshaus Rosenthal. Rosenthal was first settled in the early 13th century and documented in 1356 as the village of Rosendalle. The local village church was built in 1250 and many of the nearby buildings are from the 19th century. For much of its history, parts of Rosenthal were the location of sewage farms for the city of Berlin. This has now been turned into a nature reserve with walking trails. From 1906 until 1932, it was the location of a factory which built turbines and electric cars (Protos).   Rosenthal remains a small, urban-suburban community with primarily small garden allotments, single-family homes, and some apartment buildings. It is known for its yearly festival, the Rosenthaler Herbst (Rosenthal Autumn), which is a fair with musical acts, arts and crafts shows, and fireworks. Rosenthal has limited public transport as it is only served by tram and bus and has low rental prices. Every year the people of Rosenthal celebrate the Rosenthaler Herbst (Rosenthal Autumn[2]), which is completely organised by the Bürgerverein Dorf Rosenthal e. V., a registered, non-commercial and non-profit citizens' organisation.[3] Most of the meetings and conference are held at the old restaurant Dittmann´s. It is the only traditional restaurant that is left in Rosenthal and lasted for over 120 years since 1892. It was founded by Wilhelm Dittmann. From 1901–1903 Master mason Schreiber build a house that was supposed to be used as a school at the Hauptstraße 94. Since 1990 it is being used as a youth club called Landhaus Berlin-Rosenthal."

   "name": "Wilhelmsruh",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Wilhelmsruh station, Wilhelmsruher See. Wilhelmsruh began as a villa colony built in the late 19th century to accommodate the growing population of Berlin. In 1894, the village received the name Wilhelmsruh (William’s Rest). The area was further developed into the 20th century due to the construction of the nearby factory Bergmann Elektrizitätswerke. During World War II, the factory was used to produce armaments, and was largely destroyed by allied bombings. After 1945, Wilhelmsruh became part of the Soviet sector and the factory was partially reconstructed. With the construction of the Berlin Wall, the locality became almost an enclave as it was surrounded on three sides by West Berlin territories. The S-Bahn line was shut down and the area was only accessible by bus. With the opening of the free market after reunification, the Bergmann factory began to do poorly and this had a negative effect on the socio-economic status of the community. Single family homes and townhouses were built in the 1990s and the population increased for the first time after years of stagnation.  Wilhelmsruh is the third smallest locality in Berlin located in the northwestern part of the district of Pankow. To the west is the industrial area of the locality and rest is comprised of mostly single-family homes and apartment blocks. Wilhelmsruh is quite green and has several small parks. It is an affordable and quiet community with easy access to the city centre. In the locality, originally part of Rosenthal, it was built a country house named Nordend which received occasionally the designation name Rosenthal II. In 1892 the settlement received the name of Colonie Wilhelmsruh. As part of Nordend municipality (now a zone of Rosenthal), it merged into Berlin in 1920 with the Greater Berlin Act. During the Cold War it was part of East Berlin bordering with the western sector, and it was crossed by the Berlin Wall from 1961 to 1989. Wilhelmsruh is located in the northern suburb of Berlin, in a corner of Pankow district surrounded by Rosenthal, Niederschönhausen, Reinickendorf and Märkisches Viertel (both in Reinickendorf district). Its western corner is close to Wittenau but it doesn't borders with this locality.[1] In its territory, Wilhelmsruh counts two little lakes: Wilhelmsruhsee and Garibalditeich, this one named after Giuseppe Garibaldi and located in Garibaldistraße.

   "name": "Reinickendorf",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Dorfkirche Reinickendorf, Schäfersee. Founded around 1230, the locality (and district) takes its name apparently from one of the original settlers named Reinhard. It was first mentioned as Renekendorf in 1344. By the end of the 14th century, the village belonged to the council of the city of Berlin, and remained this way for much of its history. In the mid-19th century, the village expanded due to industrialization and with the completion of several railway lines, it became a developed suburb of Berlin and became incorporated to the city in the Greater Berlin Act of 1920. While Reinickendorf is quite far north of the city center, it has excellent access to public transport lines S-Bahn, U-Bahn, and Buses. It is a densely settled area of mostly apartment blocks, although there are some limited single-family homes and small garden allotments (Kleingartenanlagen). The western part of the locality borders the runway of Tegel Airport, one of the two airports of the city of Berlin and this may result in significant air traffic. Architecturally and culturally similar to its southern neighbor Wedding, Reinickendorf is similarly inexpensive and becoming more popular. The name of the former Reinickendorf village can be traced back to a peasant Reinhardt (Reineke in Low German), who settled here around 1230. The locality was first mentioned in a 1345 deed and acquired by the City of Berlin in 1397. The late 19th century saw a significant increase in population, when Reinickendorf received direct access to Berlin with the opening of the Nordbahn railway line to Neustrelitz in 1877. Reinickendorf was incorporated into the City of Berlin by the 1920 Greater Berlin Act. In 1928, architect Otto Rudolf Salvisberg designed the Weiße Stadt (White City), part of the Berlin Modernist Housing Estates, a UNESCO World Heritage Site."

   "name": "Tegel",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Schloss Tegel, Gorkistrasse, Dicke Marie, Greenwich Promenade. First mentioned in 1322 as Tygel, the village was likely originally founded in the mid-13th century. Tygel is a Slavic influenced, translated as appendage and likely referring to how the nearby Lake Tegel (Tegeler See) is a branch of the Havel River. In 1361, the area was purchased by the convent of Benedictine nuns at Spandau and following the protestant reformation, it came under the jurisdiction of city of Spandau until 1872. In 1558, a mansion was built for the Friedrich Wilhelm the Elector of Brandenburg to be used as a hunting lodge and it later became the seat of the influential Humboldt family. In the late 19th century, Tegel became connected to the city of Berlin via S-Bahn and it soon became a popular recreational area, and it remains so to this day. Tegel is a large locality, but is comprised mostly of forest (Tegeler Forst) in the west which stretches from the south to the north. In the south there is also Tegel Airport, which is one of the two airports of Berlin. The residential area of Tegel is to the north of the airport and is mostly apartment blocks, small garden allotments, and industrial buildings. It is the location of one of Berlin’s largest shopping malls (Borsighallen) and so has an excellent mix of both natural and urban entertainment. The Tegel Palace (or Humboldt Palace), originally a Renaissance manor house from 1558 and a hunting lodge of Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg, was bequested to the Humboldt family in 1797. Alexander von Humboldt and Wilhelm von Humboldt lived here for several years. In 1824 Wilhelm had the palace rebuilt in a Neoclassical style by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. In the park is a tomb, where Alexander, Wilhelm and other members of the Humboldt family are buried. From 1927 until 1931 Tegel Palace was the site of a sanatorium, founded by the psychoanalyst Ernst Simmel (1882-1947). From 1898 on Tegel was the seat of the Borsig-Werke steam locomotive manufacturing company until it moved to Hennigsdorf in Brandenburg in 1931. Between 1930 and 1934 an artillery firing range in the district was used by the Verein für Raumschiffahrt for experiments with liquid-fueled rockets. The principal names involved were its leader Rudolf Nebel and other staff members Hermann Oberth and Wernher von Braun. Tegel was the site of a medium wave broadcasting station from 1933 to 1948. A wire hung in a wooden tower served as an antenna. This tower was demolished as part of the construction of Tegel International Airport at the end of 1948.Tegel is chiefly known for being the location of Berlin-Tegel Otto Lilienthal, Berlin's main airport. It also houses the Tegel Penitentiary, Germany's largest prison with about 1,700 inmates as of 2007, known from Alfred Döblin's 1929 novel Berlin Alexanderplatz. One of Berlin's largest shopping malls Borsighallen is located in the former locomotive manufacturing halls of the Borsigwerke. There is also the Villa Borsig at the shore of Lake Tegel, the former residence of the Borsig family. Today it is a school for future diplomats. Dicke Marie (Fat Mary) is a registered natural monument, said to be the oldest tree in Berlin. Beside this Tegel is an extensive residential district with some industry. With the large Lake Tegel, set in woodlands, the locality is also a popular destination for daytrippers. It boasts Berlin's oldest tree, an oak called Dicke Marie (Fat Mary)."

   "name": "Konradshöhe",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Jesus-Christus-Kirche, Falkenplatz, Jörsfelder Segel-Club. Konradshöhe’s history begins in 1865 when a coppersmith named Rohmann from Berlin purchased a large tract of land from a farmer from Heiligensee. Rohmann built a coppersmith workshop and home here, and in 1868 named the settlement Conrad’s Höh (Conrad’s Heights) after his eldest son. Later, Rohmann built a restaurant and began to sell plots of land. Due to the natural beauty of the area, it soon became a favorite location for wealthy Berliners to build their villas. In 1902, Rohmann passed away, and his wife later sold the property for 75,000 Marks. A small locality bordered to the west by the Havel River and to the east by the Tegel Forest (Tegeler Forst), Konradshöhe is a beautiful area with plenty of natural beauty to recommend it. However, it is rather remote and is only connected to the rest of the city via ferry and bus and can therefore be difficult to access the center of Berlin without access to a car. Most of the residential property is comprised of single-family homes, which can make finding affordable rental properties a struggle. Konradshöhe is known as a beautiful village with plenty of opportunities for outdoor acitivities: there are many walking trails nearby in the Tegel Forest (Tegeler Forst) and boating is a popular pastime. In the course of the northern extension of Berlin during the 19th century, many people settled in the suburbs, attracted by the proximity to nature and the low price of land. One of them was the coppersmith August Friedrich Theodor Rohmann. In 1865 he acquired a property by the Havel originally intending to establish a copper mine. The settlement was officially established in 1868 and named Conrads Höh, after the oldest son of Rohmann. Part of the municipality of Heiligensee, Konradshöhe merged into Berlin in 1920 with the Greater Berlin Act. During the Cold War it was part of West Berlin with a short border to East Germany defined by the Havel. In that place the Berlin Wall was built beyond this river. Located in the north-west of Berlin, Konradshöhe is separated from the locality of Hakenfelde (in Bezirk Spandau) by the river Havel, from Tegel and Heiligensee by the eponymous forest. The river also separates Konradshöhe from the Brandenburger municipality of Hennigsdorf (in Oberhavel district)."

   "name": "Heiligensee",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Dorfkirche Heiligensee, Kirche St. Marien, Heiligenseer Feld. The area which is now Heiligensee has a long history of settlement, likely beginning around 2000 BC with the Germanic tribe the Semnones. Around 700 AD the area was taken over by Slavic tribes who were later displaced by modern German settlers around 1230 which is when the village of Heiligensee (then known as Hyelegense) was developed. It remained a small, rural village until the 20th century when it began to grow to include settlements for the workers of the nearby Borsig Factory (Borsigwerke). Heiligensee is a suburban community on the edge of the Berlin-Brandenburg border and like the neighboring Konradshöhe is surrounded by the Havel River and Tegel Forest (Tegeler Forst). It is densely settled by mostly single-family homes and small garden allotments (Kleingartenanlagen) and on average has higher rental prices than nearby areas. Despite its distance from the city center, it is well connected to public transport with two S-Bahn stations and many bus connections. While it is surrounded by forest and river, it is also only one S-Bahn stop away from the town of Hennigsdorf in Brandenburg, which is just across the river, which provides the locality with easy access to a wider variety of suburban entertainment. The village was founded in 1308.[2] Between 1945 and 1990 Heiligensee housed West Berlin's inner German border crossing for inland navigation on the Oder-Havel Canal. The crossing was open for freight vessels navigating between the People's Republic of Poland, or the Soviet Zone of occupation in Germany (till 1949, thereafter the East German Democratic Republic) and West Berlin."

   "name": "Frohnau",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Casinoturm, Wasserturm, Hubertussee, Das Buddhistische Haus. Unlike many of the suburban areas of Berlin, Frohnau was developed in the early 20th century as planned community using the theories of the Garden City. Garden Cities were areas which were created to be self-contained communities with appropriate areas of agriculture, industry, and residences. They first broke ground in 1910, but with the quick arrival of First World War, building in the area was slow to begin in earnest. Most of the area was built in the interwar years, and the area in the north-eastern part was never realized and is now part of the Waldgelände Frohnau. In the woods it is still possible to find the cobbled streets and sidewalks originally created for the never-developed settlement. In 1920, Frohnau officially became part of the state of Berlin. Following World War II, Frohnau was a part of French sector and due to its closeness to the Soviet controlled Brandenburg and only limited streets leading to West Berlin the locality became rather isolated. As the whole locality was carefully planned, Frohnau is a green, spacious area with single-family homes. There are limited rental options in the area, and what exists tends to be rather expensive despite its distance to the city center. Frohnau is well connected with buses and at its center is the S-Bahn station S Frohnau. Frohnau is an affluent area characterized by many patrician villas from the early 20th century. During the Cold War, it was part of West Berlin. Founded in 1910, Frohnau was created whole as a planned community, corresponding to the early twentieth century idea of a Garden City. Frohnau was founded in the Stolper Heath, which had been bought for the Berlin Terrain Commission by Count Guido Henckel von Donnersmarck in 1907. The competition for the design was won by a plan developed by Joseph Brix and Felix Genzmer. Their concept represented an asymmetrical, seemingly natural development out of the dunes near the Havel River. Even the name Frohnau was determined by a contest. In 1920, Frohnau was annexed into the Greater Berlin city-state. The natural centre of the city has always been the train station and the nearby buildings. The casino tower serves as the symbol of Frohnau. The entire area is noted for its large mansion-like buildings. The architects responsible for the typical mansions include Walter and Johannes Krüger (the Church of St. John), Hart and Lesser (train station and casino tower), Max Meyer (Buddhist house), Paul Poser, Max Scheidling, and Heinrich Straumer (better known for his work on Berlin's radio tower, Funkturm). Frohnau includes one of the tallest buildings in Germany: The Richtfunkmast (microwave radio tower) measures 358.6 m (1177 ft) in height and was built between 1977-1979. Up until German reunification, this was the means for keeping microwave radio contact with West Germany. The receiving tower on the West German side was in Gartow, Lower Saxony. Alongside the Richtfunkmast is a 117 m (384 ft) free-standing steel framework tower, which is dwarfed in comparison. This was built between 1970 and 1973, and had 18 m (66 ft) diameter parabolic antennae to enable radio connection beyond the horizon to Lower Saxony until 1995. Since 2002 mediumwave digital radio transmissions have been tested in Frohnau at 1485 kHz. Since neither the Richtfunkmast nor the parabolic antenna tower was intended for mediumwave transmissions, an additional 10 m (33 ft) long-wire antenna was installed."

   "name": "Hermsdorf",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Dorfkirche Hermsdorf, Heimatmuseum Hermsdorf, Hermsdorfer See. In the late 11th century, the area that would become Hermsdorf was occupied by Slavic settlers. Around 1230, German settlers arrived and took over the village although they kept the farming techniques of the Slavs, something which is noted in 1349 when the village was first documented as Hermanstorp. The village remained small and agriculturally based until the development of a station of the Berlin Northern Railway (Berliner Nordbahn) in 1877. These tracks were later replaced and the modern Bahnhof Hermsdorf was inaugurated in 1913. Hermsdorf is an area of single-family homes with plenty of green space and several small lakes. The locality is split in two by the S-Bahn tracks which run through its center. It is well connected by public transport with both S-Bahn and Bus options. Rental prices are slightly lower than in more central parts of the city, but are more expensive than other suburban localities. There are not many shopping options and it is a quiet residential area which is perhaps best enjoyed by those with access to a car. Hermsdorf borders the Tegel Forest (Tegeler Forst) to the west, and there are also several small lakes which enhance the locality’s natural beauty. First mentioned in 1200, it was an autonomous municipality merged into Berlin in 1920 with the Greater Berlin Act. During the Cold War, as part of West Berlin bordering East Germany, it was crossed by the Berlin Wall from 1961 to 1989 at its border with the municipality of Glienicke/Nordbahn."

   "name": "Waidmannslust",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Königin-Luise-Kirche, Steinbergpark. In the late 19th century as the city of Berlin began to expand, villa colonies began to pop up in formerly rural areas outside of the city. Waidmannslust began its history as one of these areas, and was first founded in 1875 when the land was acquired by the forester and innkeeper Ernst Bondick. In 1884, the Berlin Northern Railway (Berliner Nordbahn) opened a station in the locality which later became the S-Bahn station Waidmannslust. In 1913, the Queen Louise Church (Königin-Luise-Kirche) was built and it remains the landmark of the locality. Waidmannslust is a narrow locality split in two by the S-Bahn tracks. To the west of the tracks are mostly single or dual-family residences. To the east there are also similar sized residencies, as well as shopping along Oraniendamm, and Plattenbau (prefabricated highrises). Rental prices are reasonable in comparison to surrounding localities, and can be quite affordable depending on the type of residence chosen. Waidmannslust borders the charming rural village of Lübars with its many agricultural delights, and is a short ride away from the expansive Tegel Forest (Tegeler Forst). The locality was created in 1875 as a Villenkolonie.[1] In 1920 it merged in the city of Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act. During 1949–1990 it was part of the French sector of West Berlin. Situated in the north-western suburb of Berlin, not too far from Tegel's forest and lake, it borders the localities of Hermsdorf, Lübars, Wittenau and Tegel."

   "name": "Lübars",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Dorfkirche Lübars, Tegeler Fließ, Familienfarm Lübars Founded during the German eastward expansion (Ostsiedlung), Lübars was likely founded around 1230. It was originally called Lubars, meaning the place where a man called Lubas was from. Like many of the nearby villages, it was controlled by the Benedictine nuns of Spandau until the Reformation. It became a part of Berlin in 1920 with the Greater Berlin Act, and was part of West Berlin following World War II. During this time, it was something of an anomaly in West Berlin, as it was a rural community within the walled-in urban city. Today, Lübars remains a largely rural locality, with a significant portion of the land still used for farming, particularly along the northern and eastern borders. The locality continues to be known for its rural delights, such as the popular Freizeitpark Lübars and the Familienfarm Lübars, which provide young visitors an insight into agriculture and traditional crafts. The western part of the locality is densely settled with apartment blocks, single-family homes, and small garden allotments (Kleingartenanlagen). Lübars is one of the more remote localities of Berlin, and has limited public transport options. First mentioned in 1247, it was an autonomous municipality merged into Berlin in 1920 with the Greater Berlin Act. As a part of West Berlin bordering East Germany, Lübars was crossed, from 1961 to 1989, by the Berlin Wall, built beyond the Tegeler Creek (Tegeler Fließ). Famous was the Checkpoint Qualitz, a point of the wall named after Helmut Qualitz, a farmer from Lübars, who broke it on 16 June 1990 with his tractor. Situated in the north of Berlin and partially included in the area of Barnim Nature Park,[2] Lübars includes the small lakes of Ziegeleisee, Klötzbecken and part of Hermsdorfer See. The Tegeler Fließ separates Lübars from the Brandenburger municipalities, both in Oberhavel district, of Glienicke/Nordbahn and Mühlenbecker Land (with its municipal seat of Schildow). The Berliner bordering localities are Hermsdorf, Waidmannslust, Wittenau, Märkisches Viertel, Blankenfelde and Rosenthal (both in Pankow district). Lübars' principal recreation park is the eponymous one, situated in its southwestern corner."

   "name": "Wittenau",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Dorfkirche Wittenau, Ernst-Reuter-Saal, Landesarchiv Berlins. Another of the many villages surrounding Berlin which was founded in the 13th century, Wittenau began its history as the village of Dalldorf. It was owned by the convent of Benedictine nuns in Spandau until the Reformation, when in 1558 was administered by the city of Spandau. In 1869, the city of Berlin purchased property in Dalldorf to build a mental hospital then known as the Städtische Irrenanstalt zu Dalldorf (State Mental Asylum of Dalldorf). Dalldorf was primarily known for the asylum and due to the negative connotations this brought, it was decided to rename the locality in 1905 to Wittenau, after the former mayor Peter Witte. Following World War I the area was a hotbed of communist and socialist activity, and many leaders of these movements lived in the area. During the Nazi regime the area was used to build munitions which improved the economic situation of the area, but despite this there was significant resistance against the Nazis. The area was significantly damaged during World War II, and following the end of the war it became a part of the French sector of Berlin. Following the reunification of Germany, Wittenau slowly became a more popular location and the 1990’s saw a large amount of residential development throughout the locality. Today, the area is thickly settled with a wide variety of different residential housing including single-family homes, attached houses, and apartment blocks. The northern part of the locality includes several industrial areas. Wittenau is well-connected to the center of the city with S-Bahn, U-Bahn, and Bus and is also close to the Tegel Forest (Tegeler Forst) and Lake Tegel (Tegeler See). Rental prices can be significantly cheaper than more central localities, but it is important to note that Wittenau tends to have a more suburban than urban feel. Originally named Dalldorf it was first mentioned in 1332.[1] In 1869 the city of Berlin had acquired land in the Dalldorf in order to build the Städtische Irrenanstalt zu Dalldorf (City-owned Madhouse at Dalldorf), today's Karl-Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik (Karl Bonhoeffer mental home), between 1877 and 1879.[2] In the following years Dalldorf became the synonym for 'madhouse' in Berlin parlance.[3] Therefore, in 1903 Dalldorf applied at the Niederbarnim district commissioner for a new toponym, Wittenau after its late mayor Peter Witte, granted by the Prussian government with effect of 23 August 1905.[4] In 1920 Wittenau merged into Berlin by the Greater Berlin Act. Wittenau's former neighbourhood Märkisches Viertel was elevated to locality status in 1999. Until 24 April 2012 Borsigwalde, now also a locality of its own, was part of Wittenau."

As the first large housing development in West Berlin, Märkisches Viertel had a lot of input from politicians and famous architects. It was first planned in the early 1950’s and by the 1960’s over 35 domestic and foreign architects were involved in the planning. The end result was neighborhoods of tall Plattenbau (prefabricated highrises) and a large community of single-family homes. Soon after it was built it gained an unsavory reputation as the population grew faster than the infrastructure and many people were forced to move there due to gentrification in the inner-city leading to the dissolution of neighborhood ties. While the infrastructure of the area has been developed, the bad reputation remains. For this reason, Märkisches Viertel is one of the least expensive areas to rent in Berlin. The locality is accessed primarily by bus, but there is the S-Bahn and U-Bahn station Wittenau just outside of its southwestern border. It consists of a large housing estate of about 17,000 apartments with chains of high-rises up to 18 floors that were built from 1964 to 1974 by the GeSoBau Gesellschaft für sozialen Wohnungsbau (Association for Social Apartment Construction). Originally a part of Wittenau, it became an officially recognized locality of its own in 1999. To the east it shares its border with the Rosenthal and Wilhelmsruh localities of the Pankow borough, from which it was separated by the Berlin Wall until 1989. In 2003 Märkisches Viertel had about 36,000 inhabitants."

   "name": "Borsigwalde",
   "description": "At the end of the 19th century, the company Borsig, known for their construction of steam locomotives, built a factory in the locality of Tegel. As the amount of workers in the area grew, there came a need for more housing and so the locality of Borsigwalde was developed. Unlike many of the tenement housing built throughout the city of Berlin at this time, the buildings in Borsigwalde have a distinct style of red brick facades and private back gardens. In the early days of the tenements, there was rampant overcrowding and horrific hygienic conditions. Soon the area was further developed to include modern sewage systems which helped control the issue. During the depression, around ninety percent of the residents of Borsigwalde were unemployed, which rapidly changed following the Nazis seized the area in 1933 and brought in the metal and munitions industries. The area was heavily damaged during World War II and many of the factories were dismantled following the war. In the years following there were some new developments, but it wasn’t until the reunification that Borsigwalde once again became a successful industrial park. Due to the heavy damage during World War II, most of the housing available in Borsigwalde is either modern post-war apartment houses or single-family homes. The southeastern part of the locality is a large industrial park and it is near here that most of the apartments are located. It is a densely settled area with little green space although it is only a short distance away from the Tegel Forest (Tegeler Forst). The most available public transport is bus, but there is the S-Bahn stop Berlin Eichborndamm to the south of the industrial park. Rental prices in Borsigwalde are significantly cheaper than other areas of the city. The locality, named after the engineer August Borsig, was first settled in 1899[3] and, on 1 October 1920, incorporated into Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act. Part of Wittenau as a simple Ortslage, Borsigwalde became the 11th locality of Reinickendorf (and the 96th of Berlin) on 24 April 2012, following a decision by the boroughs assembly of 14 March. The decision was announced in the official gazette on 18 May 2012. Located in north of Berlin and in the middle of Reinickendorf, Borsigwalde borders with the localities of Tegel (west and south), Reinickendorf (southeast) and Wittenau (north and east). It is not too far from the Lake Tegel and on its north-eastern corner is located the Reinickendorf town hall."

   "name": "Spandau",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Rathaus Spandau, St. Nikolai Kirche, Schleuse Spandau, St. Marien am Behnitz. Due to its strategic location at the meeting of the Spree and Havel rivers, Spandau was originally the site of a Slavic fortified settlement in the 10th century. During the 12th century the settlement was taken over by Albert the Bear and by 1197 a castle was built. The Spandau Citadel (which is now included in the locality Haselhorst) was completed in 1594 and was instrumental in turning the area into a military city. By the end of World War I, Spandau was a major center of armaments throughout the Reich. In 1920, Spandau was incorporated into Berlin. During World War II, Spandau was heavily damaged and following the war it became a part of the British sector of West-Berlin. Unlike other localities in the district, Spandau is a city and has the benefits of urbanity. It is an important area of business for Berlin, but also has residential districts, large bodies of water and an extensive forest. The cultural center of the locality was traditionally in the neighborhood of Alt-Spandau, although this is has changed some due to damage from World War II and restructuring in the 1950's. While Spandau seems remote, it is easily accessible to the inner-city of Berlin and is a good option for those seeking an urban location with less-expensive rents. The city was founded at the confluence of the rivers Spree and Havel. The settlement of the area can be traced back to the 6th century when the eastern territories of the Elbe river were populated by several Slavic tribes. The history of Spandau begins in the 7th or 8th century, when the Slav Hevelli settled in the area and later built a fortress there. It was conquered in 928 by the German King Henry I, but returned to Slavic rule after the rebellion of 983. In 1156, the Ascanian count Albert the Bear took possession of the region and is believed to have established a fortress here, from which the name Spandau originated. It was around this fortress that the city of Spandow developed, becoming the centre of the entire region. It was first mentioned as Spandowe in 1197 in a deed of Otto II, Margrave of Brandenburg – 40 years earlier than the Cölln part of medieval Berlin. Spandau was given city rights in 1232. During the Ascanian Rule the construction of the Spandau Citadel began, which was completed between 1559 and 1594 by Joachim II of Brandenburg. In 1558 the village of Gatow became part of Spandau. During the Thirty Years' War Spandau was surrendered to the Swedes in 1634. In 1806, after the Battle of Jena and Auerstedt, French troops under Napoleon took possession of the city and stayed there until 1807. In 1812, Napoleon returned and the Spandau Citadel was besieged in 1813 by Prussian and Russian troops. The poet and revolutionary Gottfried Kinkel was an inmate of the Spandau town prison from 1849, until he was freed by his friend Carl Schurz on the night of November 6, 1850. Before World War I, Spandau was a seat of large, government, cannon foundries, factories for making gunpowder, and other munitions of war making, it a centre of the arms industry in the German Empire. It was also a garrison town with numerous barracks, home of the 5th Guards Infantry Brigade and the 5th Foot Guards of the German Army. In 1920, the independent city of Spandau (whose name had been changed from Spandow in 1878) was incorporated into Greater Berlin as a borough. After World War II until 1990, when Berlin was divided into four sections administered by the victorious Allies, Spandau was part of the British Occupation Sector in West Berlin. The Spandau Prison, built in 1876, was used to house Nazi war criminals who were sentenced to imprisonment at the Nuremberg Trials. After the death of its last inmate, Rudolf Hess in 1987, Spandau Prison was completely demolished by the Allied powers and later replaced by a shopping mall.Places of interest: Spandau Citadel, a Renaissance fortress built in the 16th century (officially located in Haselhorst), St. Nikolai, a late Gothic hall church of the 14th century, where Elector Joachim II Hector on November 1, 1539 attended a Lutheran service for the first time. This date is commonly regarded as the beginning of the Protestant Reformation in the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The Baroque spire was attached in 1744 and refurbished by Karl Friedrich Schinkel in 1839. (There is also a Nikolaikirche in Berlin-Mitte.), Spandau Old Town with medieval Gotisches Haus (Gothic House) of the 15th century, Rathaus Spandau, the town hall, finished in 1913."

   "name": "Haselhorst",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Spandau Citadel, Reichsforschungssiedlung Haselhorst. Despite its nearness to Spandau, Haselhorst is a relatively recent development. The land was first named in a registry in Spandau in 1590, but it wasn't until 1848 that the farming estate in the area took the name and a town began to form. In 1910, Haselhorst became a part of the city of Spandau, but ten short years later it became a part of the City of Berlin due to the Greater Berlin Act of 1920. It was the location of barracks and training grounds for the Prussian Army until 1919 and until 1945 was the site of a military production factory specializing in poisonous gases. In the southwestern part of the locality is the popular tourist location, the Spandau Citadel, one of the best preserved Renaissance military structures in Europe. Haselhorst is a densely populated suburb of Spandau. The southern part of the locality is mainly industrial and is known for the BMW motorcycle factory. This is also the part of the locality best connected to the inner-city Berlin via the U-Bahn line U7. The majority of the residential area consists of apartment blocks, but there are some single-family homes and small garden allotments (Kleingartenanlagen) in the northern parts of the locality. The locality is close to Tegel Airport and some parts potentially suffer from a large amount of air traffic. The rental prices are less expensive than the inner-city Berlin, but it is also a district without much nightlife or entertainment options. The manor of Haselhorst was incorporated into the City of Spandau in 1910 and together with it became a part of Greater Berlin in 1920. The Spandau Citadel is located in Haselhorst. The kings of Prussia kept barracks in Haselhorst. Today industries such as BMW motorcycles, Siemens and Osram are located there."

   "name": "Siemensstadt",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Christophoruskirche, Siemens-Siedlung, Wohngroßsiedlung Siemensstadt. In 1897, the area that would become known as Siemensstadt was purchased by the corporation Siemens & Halske AG to be the location of new factories. Prior to the purchase, the land was almost uninhabited and primarily consisted of meadows, woods, and wetlands.  While the factories were successful, Siemens had a hard time retaining workforce due to a long commute from either Charlottenburg or Spandau, and the company soon invested in infrastructure to draw in employees.  A stop was added to the Hamburger and Lehrter train lines to better allow commuting, and residential communities were built in the locality which included shops and apartment blocks. Several different architects were hired which led to each buildings having a unique and interesting facade. During World War II, Siemens moved its headquarters to Munich and later the area of Siemensstadt became part of West-Berlin. However, due to the tenuous political situation of the city, the factories in the area suffered and one-by-one they closed. Siemensstadt remains an architecturally interesting area with inexpensive, yet large flats. However, it continues to suffer from a lack of industry in the area. It is connected to Berlin and Spandau by bus and the U-Bahn line U7. The locality benefits from several parks, a sport center, a new shopping center, and a weekly market. It is just to the south of Tegel Airport and therefore much of the area has the potential for a lot of air traffic. The locality emerged when the company Siemens & Halske (S & H), one of the predecessors of today's Siemens AG, bought land in the area, in order to expand production of S & H and their subsidiary Siemens-Schuckertwerke (SSW) as well. On the initiative of Georg Wilhelm von Siemens S & H started to build new factories in 1899. Soon also residential buildings were erected. The locality was incorporated into Berlin on 1 October 1920 by the Greater Berlin Act."

   "name": "Staaken",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Gartenstadt Staaken, Fort Hahneberg, Grünzug Bullengraben. First mentioned in 1273 as in Stakene, the name derives from the Middle Low German To den staken which translates as the place of clubs, thick sticks, and poles. The area was first founded in the 13th century during the German eastward expansion (Ostsiedlung) and was controlled by the city of Spandau from 1295 until 1872. In 1920, it was incorporated into the city of Berlin during the Greater Berlin Act and was assigned to the district of Spandau. At the beginning of World War I in 1914, large parts of Staaken were purchased by the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin Company who built zeppelin airships and bombers. Following the end of the war, the area became an airfield, but most of the traffic transferred to the more central Tempelhof Airport. The empty zeppelin hangers were transformed into Staaken Studios which was the location for many important film productions such as Fritz Lang's Metropolis. During the partition of Germany following World War II, Staaken was unique as the locality was divided in half with the western part of the area belonging to the Soviets and the eastern part to the British. It remained a divided locality until the reunification of Germany. A densely settled locality of single-family homes and apartment blocks, Staaken is a suburban community of Spandau. While not well connected to the inner-city of Berlin, there are buses and a regional train line which goes directly to the Berlin central station. Rental prices are significantly lower than other areas of Berlin and it is potentially a good location for those working in Spandau. Staaken borders on the localities of Spandau proper, Falkenhagener Feld and Wilhelmstadt. In the west it shares border with the Brandenburg municipalities of Falkensee and Dallgow-Döberitz with the village of Seeburg, part of Havelland district. Buildings range from small detached houses and a garden city around the historic village centre in the west to larger 1960s and 1970s housing estates in the east. First mentioned in a 1273 deed as Stakene (from Middle Low German: staken, stakes) in the Mittelmark region of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, the linear settlement probably arose around 1200 in the course of the German eastward migration. The estates were then held by the Benedictine nunnery of Spandau, after the Protestant Reformation they fell to the Spandau municipal administration. The former village became part of Berlin by the Greater Berlin Act of 1920. The development of the area started with the construction of the Staaken garden city by architect Paul Schmitthenner in 1914. At the beginning of World War I the Luftschiffbau Zeppelin company acquired large estates in Staaken, where from 1915 on it manufactured zeppelin airships and the series of one-off Riesenflugzeug giant multi-engined bombers, among the largest of their day anywhere, culminating in the small series of R.VI biplane strategic bombers built by the firm. In 1919 the regulations of the Treaty of Versailles finished the production and the area was transformed into an airfield. There had been regular Zeppelin flights to Friedrichshafen and even to London from 1919 on, though in the following years most of the aviation moved to Tempelhof Airport. The former zeppelin manufacturing halls were turned into the Staaken Studios and used as the location for various film productions, e.g. parts of Fritz Lang's Metropolis. In 1929 the estate was sold to the City of Berlin, while parts of the airport were still used by the Deutsche Luft Hansa for flight training and maintenance purposes. In Albrechtshof the Demag (Deutsche Maschinenfabrik AG) built Panther tanks during World War II using forced labour of over 2,500 prisoners held in the nearby Falkenhagen labour camp, a subcamp of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. After World War II Staaken was divided by a territorial exchange contract between the Allies United Kingdom and Soviet Union of 30 August 1945. The borders of the British occupational sector of Berlin were reshaped that way, that by incorporating the so-called Seeburger Zipfel it would include the entire former Luftwaffe airfield at Berlin-Gatow in the southwestern corner of this sector. In return the so-called Dorf Staaken (village Staaken) and Albrechtshof, nowadays called West Staaken (at the most western end of the British Sector) was de jure assigned to the Soviets. The geographically eastern Staaken remained with the political West. However, the de facto administration remained with the Borough of Spandau in the British sector. So all inhabitants of Staaken could vote for West-Berlin's city state elections in 1948 and 1950. On 1 February 1951 East German Volkspolizei took over control of West Staaken, including the airfield and adjacent Neu-Jerusalem located there, and ended the administration by the Spandau Borough, instead West Staaken became an exclave of East Berlin's then Borough of Mitte. This caused the confusing fact, that the geographically western Staaken was part of the politically Eastern East Berlin at the geographically western outskirts of West Berlin, while the geographically eastern Staaken remained with the political Western British sector, thus West Berlin. East Germany then moved up its border checkpoint towards West Berlin from Dallgow more eastwards to West Staaken. On 1 June 1952 West Staaken's de facto administration was conveyed to neighbouring East German Falkensee, which incorporated West Staaken on 1 January 1961. From August 13 the same year until its opening and removal after 9 November 1989 the Berlin Wall cut through the two parts of Staaken, with one East German border crossing on Heerstraße. Since 1 January 1971 western Staaken, officially simply named Staaken, formed a municipality of its own, with a population amounting to 4,146 at that time. On 3 October 1990, the day of unification of East Germany, East and West Berlin with the West German Federal Republic of Germany both Staakens reunited to form a locality of the Spandau Borough. Albrechtshof station had been the site of a rail border crossing, it was closed in 1961 after East German railroad engineer Harry Deterling fled from the GDR by breaking through the barriers towards the Gartenstadt Staaken in West Berlin with a whole train. The event was dramatized in the 1963 West German film Durchbruch Lok 234 (The Breakthrough). The route to Albrechtshof was only reconnected in 1995 after German reunification. In 1976 the GDR opened a separate rail border crossing station Staaken for rail transit to western Germany farther away from the border to West Berlin. Up to 1980 the eastern part of Staaken inside West Berlin was served by S-Bahn. This service was abandoned by the East German Reichsbahn Headquarters after the big strike of the West Berlin Reichsbahn workers. A reconnection today is highly unlikely.The car traffic, travelling along F 5 between West Berlin and the East German Democratic Republic or the West German Federal Republic, e.g. to Hamburg, was subject to the Interzonal traffic regulations that between West Germany and West Berlin followed the special regulations of the Transit Agreement (1972). On 1 January 1988 the transit traffic to West Berlin was redirected to the new East German Stolpe checkpoint (a part of today's Hohen Neuendorf)/West Berlin-Heiligensee. From 1988 to 9 November 1989 the Heerstraße border crossing was open for the highly restricted traffic between West Berlin and East Germany. Highly restricted in this case means citizens of West Berlin must apply for a visiting permit to visit relatives, while only GDR citizens above the age of 65 could apply to visit relatives in West Berlin. Eastern controls were slowly eased into spot checks and finally abolished on 30 June 1990, the day East and West introduced the union concerning currency, economy and social safety (German: Währungs-, Wirtschafts- und Sozialunion)."

   "name": "Gatow",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Dorfkirche Gatow, Villa Lemm. Likely founded in the early 13th century, Gatow was first mentioned in 1258 as a part of the area controlled by the convent of the Benedictine nuns of Spandau. The village was controlled by the nuns until 1558 when it lost these rights during the Reformation. During the late 19th and early 20th century, several villa colonies were built. Following the division of Germany after World War II, Gatow became part of the British sector of West-Berlin. A picturesque village mainly made up of farm fields and views of the river Havel, Gatow is a small community on the outskirts of Berlin. Much of the residential area of the locality is along the banks of the Havel and there are several bathing areas. Before the fall of the Wall it used to be a popular location for West Berliners, but since the reunification it has become less crowded. Due to its remote location the rental prices are relatively low. It is a good area for those looking for a rural community by the water close to Spandau. Gatow's existence was first recorded in 1258 under the name of Gatho. In 1558, the village of Gatow became part of Spandau. Following the division of Berlin into four sectors at the end of the Second World War, Gatow became part of the British sector of West Berlin in early July 1945. Today's General-Steinhoff-Kaserne was between 1934 and 1994 home to an airfield, first used by the Luftwaffe as a staff and technical college, Luftkriegsschule II, and then by the Royal Air Force and Army Air Corps as RAF Gatow. RAF Gatow has the unlikely distinction of having been home during the Berlin Airlift to the only known operational use of flying boats within central Europe, when the RAF used Short Sunderlands to transport salt from Hamburg to Berlin, landing on the Havelsee lake. The airfield was handed back to the Luftwaffe on 7 September 1994 and was kept in use as an airfield for a very short time, being closed to air traffic in 1995. It is now called General-Steinhoff-Kaserne and is home to some non-flying Luftwaffe units, and the Luftwaffen Museum der Bundeswehr. This is the museum of the Luftwaffe which has many displays (including historic aircraft) and much information on German military aviation and the history of the airfield. Admission to the museum is free, and full details of the museum and how to get there are on the museum's website [1]. The history of RAF Gatow and of western forces in Berlin from 1945 to 1994 is told in the Alliierten Museum (Allied Museum). Also on the site of the former RAF station, but not part of General-Steinhoff-Kaserne, is a school, the Hans-Carossa-Gymnasium, and houses for government employees of the Federal Republic of Germany. This has been from 2003 part of the district of Berlin-Kladow."

   "name": "Kladow",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Militärhistorisches Museum Flugplatz Gatow, Landhausgarten Dr. Max Fränke, Dorfkirche Kladow. First mentioned as Clodow in 1267, the village of Kladow is one of the oldest areas of the district of Spandau. The name originates from the Slavic word kloda meaning tree trunk. The area was originally the location of a Slavic settlement from the 9th until the 12th century when the area was taken over by German settlers during the German eastward expansion (Ostsiedlung). In 1267, the Margave of Brandenburg granted the title and taxation rights of the land to an order of Benedictine nuns from Spandau. They lost their control of the land during the Reformation in the 16th century. From the mid-17th century the village was privately owned and a manor house was built. In 1808, a fire devastated much of the village, but by the end of the century, the village expanded to include multiple villa colonies to accommodate the growing population of Berlin. During World War II, the military airport Kaldow (Militär-Flugplatz Kladow) was built, and it later became one of the three airports of West-Berlin used during the Berlin Airlift. Kladow is a small village surrounded by beautiful countryside as it is bordered by forests, the Havel River, and the Groß Glienicker See. While some buildings are from the early 19th century, most of the developments are more modern including the Finnenhaussiedlung and Landstadt Gatow. With the opening of the new Cladow-Center, there are more shopping and restaurant options in the community. Kladow is rather remote from the center of Berlin, particularly as it the only public transport options are bus and ferry. The district of Kladow is bordered by the District of Gatow to the north, by the Havel to the east and southeast and by the State of Brandenburg (partly Potsdam) to the west and south west. The neighbouring village of Sacrow and main part of Groß Glienicke are located in Brandenburg. With around 11,500 residents, Kladow has managed to keep its village character, even though it is a part of the German capital. Kladow was first mentioned as Clodow in 1267, which makes it the oldest section of Spandau. Intensive settlement of what had previously been farming villages began in the early 19th century. At the border of Greater Berlin, Kladow was annexed into Spandau in 1920. Kladow has since 2003 contained part of the former airfield of RAF Gatow, which was, along with Tempelhof and Tegel, one of the three airports that made the Berlin Airlift possible. Today, Kladow describes itself as a village in a city of millions. Buildings such as the Gut Neukladow (1800) and the Village Church (1818) date back to the 17th and 18th centuries, although there are also many new housing estates, such as the Finnenhaussiedlung erected in 1959/60. The newest housing estate in the area is the former Gatow Airport (most of which is again part of Kladow), known as the Landstadt for civil servants. Most of the building plots are still available due to a lack of demand. With the dedication of a new shopping center (The Cladow-Center), life has partially moved out from the village's center. Nevertheless, this area still offers a rich, long-established selection of stores and restaurants."

   "name": "Hakenfelde",
   "description": "Evangelical Johannesstift Berlin, Wichernkirche. The first developments in Hakenfelde began in 1730 when it was the site of a dairy farm for the suburbs of Spandau, and takes its name from the owner of said farm, the merchant Johann Ludwig Haake. Later, it was the location of a small manor which hosted the dancer Pepita de Oliva. By the turn of the century there was a restaurant called Karlslust which in 1947 became the location of one of the biggest fire disasters in the city’s history, killing 80 people. About two-thirds of the locality is made up of the Spandauer Forst (Spandauer Forest) which is a popular recreational area for walking and cycling. Most of the residential neighborhoods contain single family homes, but along the southeastern border there are several modern apartment blocks. The only public transport options are several bus lines, and so it is quite remote from the rest of the city. Be aware that due to its closeness to Tegel Airport, that is likely a large amount of air traffic. The name Hakenfelde is derived a dairy-farm built in 1730 on the outskirts of Spandau.[1] Part of the town of Spandau it merged into Berlin in 1920 with the Greater Berlin Act. Due to its position at the borders of West Berlin within East Germany it was largely crossed, from 1961 to 1989, by the Berlin Wall.[2] In 2003 it became an autonomous Ortsteil, separated (with Falkenhagener Feld and Wilhelmstadt) from the one of Spandau. Located in the northeastern suburb of the city, Hakenfelde is surrounded by the Spandauer Forest and separated from the district of Reinickendorf by the river Havel. It borders with the Brandenburger municipalities of Falkensee, Schönwalde-Glien and Hennigsdorf, all in the district of Havelland. The bordering Ortsteil are Falkenhagener Feld, Haselhorst, Spandau, Reinickendorf and Konradshöhe (both in Reinickendorf district). On the Havel there is an island (Eiswerder) and 3 islets (Pionierinsel, Großer Wall and Kleiner Wall) belonging to Hakenfelde. Eiswerder, situated in the middle of the Lake Spandau (Spandauer See), is linked to Hakenfelde and Haselhorst by 2 bridges."

   "name": "Falkenhagener Feld",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Städtischer Friedhof In den Kisseln, Denkmal Großsiedlung Falkenhagener Feld. Originally agricultural and garden allotments (Kleingartenanlagen), Falkenhagener Feld was developed due to a housing shortage in West Berlin. The area was developed between 1962 and the late 1990’s. In recent years there have been some social issues in the area, but these are being addressed by neighborhood management (Quartiersmanagement). Falkenhagener Feld is a densely populated locality with a mix between apartment buildings and single-family homes. There are several parks which provide green space and lakes. While the rental prices are low in comparison to other areas, it is well removed from the city center of Berlin and only accessible by car or bus. The project to build a residential complex in the rural area of west Spandau and close to the village of Falkenhagen, started in 1962.[1] The locality, situated at the borders of West Berlin with East Germany, was crossed by the Berlin Wall until 1989. In 2003 it became an autonomous Ortsteil, separated (with Hakenfelde and Wilhelmstadt) from the one of Spandau."

   "name": "Wilhelmstadt",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Jaczo-Schlucht, Tiefwerder Wiesen. Wilhelmstadt began its history in the 16th century as a part of the fortifications of the city of Spandau. However, this settlement burned down in 1813, and it was only in the late 19th century that it grew once again as a suburb of the up-and-coming city of Spandau. Its named was changed to Wilhelmstadt in 1897 to honor the 100th birthday of Kaiser Wilhelm I. It was also the location of the internationally famous Spandau Prison which detained the war criminals of the Third Reich. It was demolished in 1987 following the death of its final inmate. With plenty of green space and easy access to the lake Scharfe Lanke and the Havel River, Wilhelmstadt is a beautiful suburban community. To the north, there are primarily early 20th century tenement houses, the south mainly single-family homes, and the east consists of the large former floodplains, the Tiefwerder Wiesen, which is now a park. It is served by several bus lines and easily accessible by car, but the nearest S-Bahn is in the neighboring district of Spandau which makes it remote from the city center of Berlin. The rental prices are low, reflecting this remoteness. In the year 1945 the allied armed forces from the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom accomplished an exchange of territory, among the area of Seeburg in Spandau.[1] This new quarter was crossed, from 1961 to 1989 by the Berlin Wall, due to its position at the borders of West Berlin with East Germany. It became an autonomous Ortsteil in 2003, separated (with Hakenfelde and Falkenhagener Feld) from the one of Spandau. Wilhelmstadt is situated in the western suburb of Berlin, close to the central area of Spandau. It borders with the Brandenburg municipality of Dallgow-Döberitz (Havelland district) and with the localities of Staaken, Spandau, Gatow, Westend and Grunewald (both in Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf). Traversed by the Havel river, Wilhelmshaven counts a former floodplain named Tiefwerder Wiesen and the lakes Scharfe Lanke, Grimnitzsee, Pichelssee, Südparkteich and part of Stößensee. The peninsula of Pichelswerder, part of its Ortslage Pichelsdorf borders with the Grunewald forest,[2] and is separated from the rest of it by the Stößensee."

   "name": "Steglitz",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Bierpinsel, Gutshaus Steglitz, Rathaus Steglitz, Spiegelwand. At the sight of a medieval trading route which stretched from Aachen and Cologne in West Germany all the way to Berlin, Steglitz has always profited from its location. It was founded in the late-12th century and was first documented in 1375. With the construction of the railroad between Berlin and Potsdam, Steglitz was boosted financially and socially. During the late 19th century, the surrounding area was developed as a luxurious residential area of mansion and villa colonies and Steglitz town became a major shopping area. As it was historically, Steglitz remains today a popular shopping area for residents of Berlin, in particular around the area of Schloßstraße. It is easily accessible with public transport and it has the most distinctly urban flair of the district.   While one Knight Henricus of Steglitz was already mentioned in an 1197 deed, the village of Steglitz was first mentioned in the 1375 Landbuch of Emperor Charles IV, at this time alsoSteglitz witnessed the construction of the first paved Prussian country road, in 1792. The former village profited largely from its location on the Imperial Highway Reichsstraße 1, today Bundesstraße 1, which follows a trading route that dates back to the Middle Ages. The old Reichsstraße stretched from the far West of Germany through Aachen and Cologne to Berlin, then continued on eastward to end some two hundred miles northeast of Königsberg in East Prussia. The village of Steglitz was also boosted significantly with the construction of the Stammbahn line of the Prussian state railways in 1838. This was the first railroad in Prussia and ran between Berlin and Potsdam. The Steglitz area was included in the southern line of Berlin's rail and transit systems from around 1850.  ruler of the Brandenburg Electorate. The southwestern surroundings of Berlin saw considerable change in the second half of the 19th century when luxurious residential areas were developed in the neighboring villages of Lichterfelde and later Dahlem. Lichterfelde West and East, founded by the entrepreneur Johann von Carstenn were developed as so called Villenkolonien, settlements made up entirely of mansions or villas. In the east the settlement of Südende (South End) was founded in 1873. In Steglitz proper a major shopping area developed around the Schloßstraße, catering also to the wealthy villages of Lichterfelde and Dahlem. In 1901 the first Wandervogel youth group was founded in the basement of the Steglitz town hall. Steglitz was incorporated into the city of Greater Berlin in 1920 together with neighboring villages. From 1920 to 2000 the administrative district IX was called Bezirk Steglitz. During the time of the Berlin Wall Steglitz formed part of the American Sector. In Berlin's 2001 administrative reform the Berlin southwestern area was united in the newly created borough of Steglitz-Zehlendorf, with its expensive residential developments today the most affluent of the twelve Berlin boroughs. Points of interest: Gutshaus Steglitz (Steglitz Manor), a Neoclassical building designed by David Gilly in 1801, which since 1921 housed the small Schlossparktheater, one of the former Berlin state theatres, that nevertheless finally closed in 2006, The Schloßstraße, the second largest shopping area in West Berlin after Kurfürstendamm and Tauentzienstraße, including Forum Steglitz, one of Germany's first shopping malls opened in 1970, Neo-Gothic Steglitz town hall, erected in 1898, Lutheran Matthew Church, built in 1880, Catholic Rosary church from 1900, which received the title of a basilica in 1950, The notorious Steglitzer Kreisel, a 119 m (390 ft) highrise erected between 1968 and 1980, designed by architect Sigrid Kressmann-Zschach. Before the construction was finished the developing company became insolvent in 1974, leaving a ruin in Steglitz' centre until the works were resumed in 1977. To avoid further vacancy the borough's administration moved in, but had to leave the building in 2007 due to a contamination with asbestos. The building includes the Berlin U-Bahn station Rathaus Steglitz, a bus station and a multi-storey car park, The Bierpinsel (Beer Brush), a tavern in a tower on Schlossstraße with an interesting architectural style built in 1976, Villenkolonie Lichterfelde West, historical district of 19th-century mansion houses and cobbled streets in the adjacent Lichterfelde district, Titania-Palast, a large cinema erected in 1928 in New Objectivity style. On May 26, 1945, it was the site of the first concert of the Berlin Philharmonic orchestra after World War II. On June 6, 1951 it saw the opening ceremony of the first Berlin International Film Festival, The Fichtenberg hill, highest point in Steglitz, 68 m (223 ft), The Grundschule am Insulaner is an elementary and middle school near Südende, Die Spiegelwand - Mirrored Wall - is a Holocaust Memorial with the names and addresses of 1700 Jews in the Steglitz area who were deported and murdered in Nazi concentration camps. Take either U-Bahn or S-Bahn to Rathaus-Steglitz. The Memorial is right across the street from the Station, McNair Barracks - Prior to the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Berlin following reunification, three infantry battalions and a 155mm artillery battery were located at McNair Barracks in Lichterfelde. During readiness alerts, U.S. units would form up on the 4. Juli Platz between the kaserne and Parkfriedhof Lichterfelde, then move to their tactical assembly areas."

   "name": "Lichterfelde",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Otto Lilienthal monument, Dorfkirche Lichterfelde, Botanical Gardens, Gutshaus Lichterfelde. Founded in the 13th century by Flemish settlers, Lichterfelde was a small farming village until the late 19th century when the area saw significant growth as an area of several villa and mansion colonies for wealthy Berliners.  It was the seat of the Prussian Main Military Academy (Hauptkadettenanstalt) in 1882, and thus the area became popular with wealthy families with connections to the Prussian military. From 1933 until 1945, the grounds of the military academy housed the SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler, Hitler’s personal bodyguards. During World War II, Lichterfelde-Ost was severely damaged, but Lichterfelde-West remained largely intact making it one of the most desirable residential areas of Berlin today. Lichterfelde is characterized by its impressive villas and mansions and botanical gardens. The architectural interesting houses and the sedate atmosphere of the surrounding area make it an extremely popular residential area, but due to its relative distance from the city center, rental prices remain within the city average.   The Prussian village Lichtervelde was founded in the 13th century by Flemish settlers. It witnessed considerable growth in the 19th century when the two villa colonies of Lichterfelde-West and Lichterfelde-Ost were founded: two elegant settlements for wealthy Berliners consisting completely of villas or mansions. The settlements and the historical villages of Lichterfelde and Giesensdorf were united in 1880 under the name Groß-Lichterfelde (Greater-Lichterfelde). (Hauptkadettenanstalt) in 1882, and the district became home to many famous German noble families that were linked to the Prussian Army. The world's first commercially successful electrified streetcar line, the Gross-Lichterfelde tramway, opened between the Lichterfelde-Ost railway station and the Hauptkadettenanstalt in 1881.  In 1920 Lichterfelde became part of Greater Berlin. Between 1920 and 1933, the former military academy in Lichterfelde was used by the Berlin Police. From 1933 to 1945, the grounds of the military academy were the home of the SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler. During this same period, the Kreisauer Kreis resistance group around Count Peter Yorck von Wartenburg and Helmuth James Graf von Moltke held its secret meetings in Wartenburg's apartment on Hortensienstraße 50, Lichterfelde-West, during the Third Reich. Generaloberst Ludwig Beck had his house on Goethestraße 24 in Lichterfelde-Ost. From 1945 to 1994 the Hauptkadettenanstalt was used as Andrews Barracks by the United States Army Berlin Brigade. Today it belongs to the German Federal Archives (Bundesarchiv), headquartered in Koblenz. Two other kasernes Roosevelt Barracks in Gardeschützen-Kaserne (former seat of the Prussian Guards Rifles Battalion) and McNair Barracks, a former Telefunken manufacturing plant on Goerzallee were nearby. While Lichterfelde-Ost was in parts badly damaged during World War II, Lichterfelde-West is still largely intact and today one of the prime residential areas of Berlin. The Lichterfelde locality also houses the Berlin-Dahlem Botanical Garden and Botanical Museum and the Campus Benjamin Franklin, built in 1968 and today part of the Charité university hospital.Otto Lilienthal monument - The memorial plaque which is located in Schütte-Lanz-Straße 25, Berlin-Lichterfelde, was built in memory of Otto Lilienthal - a German pioneer of human aviation who became known as the Glider King. He was the first person to make successful gliding flights."

   "name": "Lankwitz",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Dreifaltigkeitskirche. Lankwitz was originally a Slavic settlement which went by the name Lancowice which meant place at the Uferaue. It refers to the canal Lanke which once went through the area. The area was first mentioned in historical records in 1239 and it primarily consisted of farmers. As the area was taken over by German settlers, they built a church which was likely built around 1250. The area remained rural for most of its history before being built up as a villa colony. On August 24th, 1943, the village center was bombed and many buildings, including the historic church, town hall, and the Schloss Lankwitz were destroyed. By the end of World War II approximately 85% of the area was destroyed. Today, Lankwitz is known as a bit of University town as the Freie Universität Berlin has several satellite departments in the locality. As the area is primarily comprised of buildings built after World War II, the rents are significantly cheaper than in surrounding localities. In Lankwitz it is possible to find large, inexpensive flats, something that is becoming increasingly rare as Berlin becomes a more popular city. The locality is served by bus and the S-Bahn stop S Lankwitz which is in the north-west. The locality was first mentioned in 1239 with the name of Lankowice.[1] Autonomous Prussian municipality of the former Teltow district, Lankwitz was incorporated into Berlin in 1920, with the Greater Berlin Act. Lankwitz is situated in the southern suburb of Berlin, close to the borders with the Brandenburg. It borders with the localities of Steglitz, Lichterfelde, Mariendorf, Marienfelde (both in Tempelhof-Schöneberg district) and, in a short point represented by a bridge over the Teltowkanal, with Tempelhof.[2] The Teltowkanal also remarks the boundary between Lankwitz and Steglitz."

   "name": "Zehlendorf",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Dorfkirche Zehlendorf, Haus am Waldsee, Schlachtensee. First mentioned in 1245 as Cedelendorp, Zehlendorf likely takes its name from a previous Slavic settlement meaning Noble Village. It was a small farming community until in 1838 the Prussian railway opened the Potsdam-Zehlendorf-Berlin line. Within thirty years the area started to become popular as for the first time it was possible to live in the countryside while working in the city due to public transport. The area soon became a popular location for architects to live and the villas, mansions, and housing estates that were built reflect this. A popular area for Nazi officials during the war, it became a part of the American Sector and the American influence continues to this day, notably as it is the location of the popular German-American public school the John F. Kennedy School. Today, Zehlendorf is a leafy suburb of mostly single-family homes. It is a popular location for the American expat community as it is the location of John F. Kennedy School which grants both American high school diplomas and German diplomas. Zehlendorf is a popular area for families due to its middle-class suburban feel and the rental prices are high as a result. There is a lot of public transport options such as bus, U-Bahn, and S-Bahn, but it is some distance from the city center. Before Berlin's 2001 administrative reform Zehlendorf was a borough in its own right, consisting of the locality of Zehlendorf as well as Wannsee, Nikolassee and Dahlem. Zehlendorf contains some of the most remarked upon natural settings in Berlin, including parts of the Grunewald forest and the Schlachtensee, Krumme Lanke and Waldsee lakes. Additionally, it has large affluent residential neighborhoods, some with cobblestone streets and buildings that are over 100 years old. It is one of the most expensive areas in Berlin for housing. The village of Zehlendorf was first mentioned as Cedelendorp in a 1245 contract between the Margraves John I and Otto III of Brandenburg and the Lehnin Abbey. Probably a German foundation, the name Cedelen may refer to a former Slavic settlement from the 7th century, or be a dialect word for settlement (modern German Siedlung), or noble (Cedelendorp = Cedelen + dorp, noble village (see Jahresbericht über die Erscheinungen auf dem Gebiete der germanischen Philologie). In the affluent and well-educated environment of Zehlendorf, top World War II figures mingled with opponents of the Nazi regime. Express S-Bahn trains, known as the Banker Trains whisked them at 120 km/h (75 mph) to the financial and government centers until the service was disrupted towards the end of World War II.  Visitors can stop at the Dahlem Church, where the vicar, Pastor Martin Niemöller, served from 1931 through 1937. Niemöller's sermons against the Nazis led to his imprisonment and the publication of them in English during the war helped shape discussion of the nature of National Socialism in Christian circles. Many walking trips are available in and around Zehlendorf. Popular destinations include the Grunewald trails north from the Onkel Toms Hütte U-Bahn station and neighborhood shopping center, the walk from Krumme Lanke U-Bahn station to the lake of the same name, and the cross-Zehlendorf walk from the end of the U-Bahn at Krumme Lanke to the S-Bahn station in the center of old Zehlendorf. Zehlendorf shopping center has undergone major changes with plenty of new construction centering on the S-Bahn station Zehlendorf. When American forces occupied Berlin and later were stationed in Berlin during the Cold War, Zehlendorf with the Steuben Barracks, Dahlem and Lichterfelde were the areas where most of those forces were centered, including elements of the Berlin Brigade stationed at the McNair Barracks."

   "name": "Dahlem",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Allied Museum, Museumszentrum Berlin-Dahlem, Brücke Museum, St. Annen-Kirche. Dahlem began its history as a village connected to the Dahlem Demesne, or the lands of a local manor. It remained a small rural village until the estate was sold to the state of Prussia in 1841. Thereafter the village began to be developed as a mansion and villa colony, similar to the other surrounding localities. After the partition of Germany, Dahlem was a part of the American sector and was the location of the Allied Kommandatura of Berlin until 1991. The district has a deep cultural tie with America due to this and the Embassy of the United States retains several buildings in the locality. Dahlem is also the location of the main campus of the Freie Universität Berlin which was founded in 1948 by the West German government. Dahlem is a quiet, leafy suburb with the flair of a university town. During the week, hundreds of students arrive via the U-Bahn, but the district itself is not known for being populated by students due to its high rental prices. It is well connected by both S-Bahn and U-Bahn stops and is a popular location for the American expat community. There is much to do in Dahlem with interesting museums, the historical hunting lodge (Jagdschloss Grunewald), and the western part of the locality containing part of the Grunewald forest.   Until Berlin's 2001 administrative reform it was a part of the former borough of Zehlendorf. Dahlem is one of the most affluent parts of the city and an important historical center for academic research. Dahlem is home to the renowned Freie Universität Berlin with its Philological Library (The Brain) by Norman Foster as an important local landmark. Several other research institutions, the Berlin Botanical Garden (officially on the ground of neighbouring Lichterfelde) and many museums are located there. Although Dahlem has a reputation of an idyllic and quiet area, it is very busy with students arriving by U-Bahn on weekdays. The western part of the locality includes parts of the Grunewald forest, including the Renaissance Grunewald hunting lodge built in 1543.  The first written account of Dahlem dates to the year 1275. The history of the village is connected to the Dahlem Demesne (Domäne Dahlem) first mentioned in 1450. Its estates were sold to the state of Prussia in 1841 and developed by dividing it into lots for building villas and mansions. The Demesne buildings today house a working farm and an agricultural open-air museum. In 1920 the village was amalgamated into Greater Berlin. From 1931 on Martin Niemöller, a leader of the Confessing Church, was pastor of the United Protestant Sankt-Annen-Kirche until he was arrested by the Nazis in 1937. During the Cold War Dahlem belonged to the American Sector of West Berlin. From 1945 to 1991 the seat of the Allied Kommandatura of Berlin was in Dahlem on Kaiserswerther Straße. Today it serves as the office for the president of the local university. Until 1994, the headquarters of the United States Army Berlin command and the Berlin Brigade were located on Clayallee street. Parts of the building are still used by the Embassy of the United States in Berlin. The former library and Outpost theater across the street today house the (West-)Allied Museum. Because many of Berlin's artistic, cultural, and educational institutions were located in the city's historical center in the former eastern part of Berlin, West Berlin authorities established many duplicates in Dahlem - above all the Freie Universität Berlin (literally the Free University Berlin) in 1948, which was established by students and scholars as an antipole to the increasingly communist Universität Unter den Linden. The newly founded university should uphold the traditional values of academic freedom and the educational ideal proposed by Wilhelm von Humboldt. Rudi Dutschke, spokesman of the German student movement in the 1960s, is buried at the cemetery of the Sankt-Annen-Kirche."

   "name": "Nikolassee",
   "description": "Remarkable places: S-Bahnhof Nikolassee, Kirche Nikolassee, Strandbad Wannsee. Similar to its neighbors, Nikolassee was developed as a villa colony as the bourgeois of Berlin sought out expensive homes in the countryside in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. When the railway station was completed in 1902, the area was still just open fields, but this quickly changed as it developed into a community of upscale mansions and villas. During the partition of Berlin, Nikolassee was a part of the American sector. Nikolassee is rural suburb of Berlin with many parks and lakes. It is served by the S-Bahn stop Berlin-Nikolassee. Much of the area of the locality is public parkland and is part of the Grunewald forest. Only the southeast is developed with mansions, single-family homes, and some apartment blocks. It is a popular area and has higher rental prices than most suburban communities in Berlin. Located in the affluent Southwest of the city, the area comprises parts of the Schlachtensee neighbourhood and the eastern shore of the Großer Wannsee lake with the large Strandbad Wannsee lido,[2] as well as the islets of Schwanenwerder and Lindwerder.  Nikolassee is located on the Bundesstraße 1 road from the Berlin city centre to Potsdam, south of the extended Grunewald forest. The river Havel separates it from Kladow and Gatow in the Spandau brorugh. Other localities bordering with Nikolassee are Wannsee, Zehlendorf and Grunewald (this one in Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district [4]). Its southern neighbour Kleinmachnow is a municipality in the Potsdam-Mittelmark district of Brandenburg. The residential areas of Nikolassee and Grunewald are separated by the Grunewald forest. Once part of the Düppel manor, from 1901 onwards the area was developed as a mansion colony (Villenkolonie Nikolassee). One year later, the settlement received connection to the Berlin-Blankenheim and Wannsee Railway lines with the opening of Berlin-Nikolassee station.  Originally an independent Brandenburg municipality, Nikolassee was incorporated into Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act of 1920. Part of West Berlin during the Cold War, its southern border with the municipality of Kleinmachnow, at the same time the border between the American Sector and what was to be the East Germany, was fortified by the Berlin Wall between 1961 and 1989. Located on the present A 115 motorway was the US Checkpoint Bravo (Drewitz-Dreilinden), built in 1969."

   "name": "Wannsee",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Liebermann Villa, Haus der Wannsee-Konferenz. A large locality which is mostly parkland, Wannsee has long been a popular location for Berliners looking for natural beauty and swimming opportunities. The railway station at Wannsee opened in 1874, providing Berliners their first opportunities to visit the area. In the late 19th century, Wannsee was developed as a villa colony and attracted a host of famous residents such as the painter Max Liebermann. The villas were mostly congregated on the shore of the Lake Wannsee. One of these villas became the location of the Wannsee Conference, where top Nazi officials met and came up with the Final Solution which led to the Holocaust. This villa is now memorial site called the Haus der Wannsee-Konferenz. Wannsee remains a small community without many options for renters. It is a popular area due to its quietness and natural beauty, and the rents are higher than most suburban areas outside of Berlin. Most of the residential area is comprised of single-family homes. At the western rim of the Wannsee locality the Glienicke Bridge connects it with the city of Potsdam. The late neoclassical Glienicke Palace as well as the Pfaueninsel are nearby. Since 1990 these palaces and parks are part of the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin UNESCO World Heritage Site. The locality is centred on the ancient village of Stolpe, known to exist in 1299. The locality also includes the districts of Kohlhasenbrück, named after the 1811 novella Michael Kohlhaas by Heinrich von Kleist, and Steinstücken, which in the Cold War days became famous as a tiny exclave of West Berlin within the GDR. Wannsee lake is well known as the number-one bathing and recreation spot for western Berlin, especially from a 1951 Schlager hit by teen idol Cornelia Froboess. The Strandbad Wannsee, an open-air lido with one of the longest inland beaches in Europe and a popular nudist area, was built in 1929-1930 after a concept by architect Richard Ermisch. Situated on the eastern shore of the lake it is officially part of the Nikolassee locality.  The history of Wannsee as a sublime suburb of Berlin began when Great Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg ordered the construction of a hunting lodge, the so called Jagdschloss Glienicke. The castle remained for generations the hunting lodge of the Hohenzollern family and was rebuilt and expanded several times during this time. Today the castle houses an institute for social education. In 1793, the Prussian king Frederick William II, a descendant of Frederick William, acquired the island Pfaueninsel (German: Peacock Island) in the Havel river and had the Pfaueninsel castle built for himself and his mistress Wilhelmine Enke in 1794-1797. Jagdschloss Glienicke and Pfaueninsel castle are both part of UNESCO World Heritage Site Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.  On 21 November 1811, German writer Heinrich von Kleist shot himself on the shore of the Kleiner Wannsee and, at her bidding, his lover, Henriette Vogel. A memorial marks the site. Glienicke Palace (German: Schloss Glienicke) was designed in neoclassical style by Karl Friedrich Schinkel for Prince Carl of Prussia in 1826. It used to be the summer palace of the prince. Together with the Russian style ensemble Nikolskoe around the church Ss. Peter and Paul (German: St. Peter und Paul) on the top of a hill on the banks of the Havel river, it also belongs to the UNESCO World Heritage Site Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin. Nikolskoe, consisting of the church, a cottage, a school and a cemetery, was established from 1813 to 1837 at the suggestion by the Russian Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, the daughter of King Frederick William III of Prussia. Her brother Prince Carl, constructor of Glienicke Palace, was buried in the church after his death. Today the church is especially popular for weddings and the cottage is housing a restaurant. The Verein Seglerhaus am Wannsee, the second oldest yacht club in Germany, was established in October 1867 on a small wooden shack by River Havel. In 1877 it moved to its present location at the edge of the lake.  In 1909, Max Liebermann, head of the Berlin Secession, had a villa built at the western shore of the Wannsee. His widow was forced to sell it to the Deutsche Reichspost in 1940. Today, the property is a museum in honor of the painter. Especially worth seeing is the garden, which was a popular Liebermann motif. In 1928, a large shooting range was established in the Düppel woods near the Berlin city limits. It was the site of the shooting part of the shooting events of the 1936 Summer Olympics. A golf course hosted the running part of the modern pentathlon at those same games. After World War II, it was used by the US Army as the Rose Range firing compound. On 20 January 1942, senior Nazi officials met at the Wannsee Villa (built 1914-1915) to ensure the cooperation of the major government organizations in the Final Solution to the Jewish Question, the extermination of the Jews of Europe. The event, presided over by Reinhard Heydrich and conducted by Adolf Eichmann, has since become known as the Wannsee Conference. Today, the building serves as a memorial and education centre. In 1944, after the failure of the assassination attempt on Hitler in which he had been involved, senior SS and Gestapo official Arthur Nebe went into hiding on an island in the Wannsee but was later arrested after a rejected mistress betrayed him."

   "name": "Schöneberg",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Rathaus Schöneberg, Kaufhaus des Westens (KaDeWe), Wittenberg Platz, Königskolonnaden, Gasometer Schöneberg. Like much of the outlying districts, Schöneberg has a long history as a village and was founded in the 13th century. In 1751, a new village was founded by Bohemian weavers and came to be known as Neu-Schöneberg or Boehmisch-Schöneberg. The two villages remained separate from one another until 1874. The area was heavily damaged by Russian and Habsburg troops during the Seven Year’s War in 1760, but was heavily redeveloped in the middle 19th century. Many poor residents made money from this development and built mansions on Hauptstraße. Schöneberg became an independent city in 1899 and was incorporated into the city of Berlin in 1920. During the partition of Germany, the historical Rathaus Schöneberg became the city hall of West Berlin and is the famous location where John F. Kennedy gave his Ich bin ein Berliner speech in 1963. Schöneberg is divided into several neighborhoods, each with their own distinct flavor, but two are the most historically significant: the Bavarian Quarter (Bayrisches Viertel) and the Red Island (Rote Insel). The Bavarian Quarter is in the western part of the locality, and is comprised of streets named after Bavarian cities. It is historically a wealthy area and continues to be one of the most sought-after residential areas in the city. Once one of the largest Jewish quarters of Berlin, the population was devastated by the Holocaust. In remembrance of this tragedy, the memorial The Places of Remembrance in the Bavarian Quarter (Orte des Erinnerns im Bayerischen Viertel) is now a focal point. In the northeast of Schöneberg is the Rote Insel, a large area which is separated from the rest of the locality by three S-Bahn tracks which make the area into a man-made island. The neighborhood was historically to the left politically (hence the red in its name) leading to clashes during the rise of National Socialism. The large Gasometer Schöneberg has become a landmark of the neighborhood. Schöneberg is a locality that ranges from hustling inner-city to quieter urban residential with a wide range of cultural and social sights. Rental prices vary greatly throughout with Wittenbergplatz and Bayrischer Platz at the higher end, while the area to the south is significantly cheaper. The neighborhood of Nollendorfplatz has historically been considered the centre of the gay scene in Berlin since the 1920’s and is the host of Europe’s largest gay and lesbian festival. The village was first documented in a 1264 deed issued by Margrave Otto III of Brandenburg. In 1751 Bohemian weavers founded Neu-Schöneberg also known as Böhmisch-Schöneberg along northern Hauptstraße. During the Seven Years' War on 7 October 1760 Schöneberg and its village church were completely destroyed by a fire due to the joint attack on Berlin by Habsburg and Russian troops. Both Alt-Schöneberg and Neu-Schöneberg were in an area developed in the course of industrialization and incorporated in a street network laid out in the Hobrecht-Plan in an area that came to be known architecturally as the Wilhelmine Ring. The two villages were not combined as one entity until 1874 and received town privileges in 1898. In the following year it was disentangled from the Kreis Teltow and became a Prussian Stadtkreis (independent city). Many of the former peasants gained wealth by selling their acres to the settlement companies of growing Berlin and built luxurious mansions on Hauptstraße. The large town hall Rathaus Schöneberg was completed in 1914. In 1920 Schöneberg became a part of Greater Berlin. Subsequent to World War II the Rathaus served as the city hall of West Berlin until 1991 when the administration of the reunited City of Berlin moved back to the Rotes Rathaus in Mitte. The locality of Schöneberg includes the neighbourhoods of Bayerisches Viertel (Bavarian quarter, an affluent residential area with streets named after Bavarian towns) and the Rote Insel (literally: red island) as well as Lindenhof and the large natural park area Südgelände (south grounds) on the outside of the Ringbahn railway circle line. The area around Nollendorfplatz has been a centre of gay life in Berlin since the 1920s and early 1930s during the Weimar Republic. The Eldorado Night Club on Motzstraße was closed down by the Nazis on coming to power in 1933. The painter and printmaker Otto Dix used patrons of this establishment as subjects for some of his famous works. Christopher Isherwood lived just around the corner on Nollendorfstraße. This apartment was the basis for his book Goodbye to Berlin (1939) and later the musical Cabaret (1966) and the film Cabaret (1972) and is commemorated by a historic plaque on the building. Popular sights: Dorfkirche, the old village church, from 1766, Rathaus Schöneberg, 1914 at John-F.-Kennedy-Platz, where on 26 June 1963 U.S. President John F. Kennedy held his Ich bin ein Berliner speech, Headquarters of the RIAS Berlin (Radio in the American Sector) from 1948–1993, then headquarters of DeutschlandRadio Berlin from 1994 until the station was renamed Deutschlandradio Kultur in 2005. The building was erected in 1941 by the IG Farben conglomerate, Former headquarters of the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG), the public transport company of Berlin, on Potsdamer Straße, Kaufhaus des Westens (KaDeWe), the largest department store in continental Europe, at Wittenbergplatz, Heinrich-von-Kleist-Park, first laid out in 1656 by Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg as a nursery, later Berlin's Botanical Garden, which in 1910 moved to Dahlem. In 1913 the Kammergericht appellate court building was erected within the park, together with two colonnades by Carl von Gontard from 1780, which had been moved here from the Alexanderplatz. On 8 August 1944 it was the site of the Volksgerichtshof show trial of members of the 20 July plot led by judge-president Roland Freisler. From 1945 on, the building served as the seat of the Allied Control Council in Berlin. When the Soviet representatives left the Council in 1948 the Berlin Air Safety Center remained there as the only four-power authority (beside Spandau Prison), while the rest of the building was empty. Today it again serves as the seat of the Kammergericht, Pallasstraße Hochbunker, a former air raid shelter, built in 1943 by forced laborers. A large social housing estate which was built in 1977 to partially bridge over the bunker and to across the street, the former site of the Berlin Sportpalast. The building where Joseph Goebbels held his 1943 Total War speech was demolished in 1973. The present housing estate is known to Berliners as the Sozialpalast (Social Palace), Lutherkirche at Denewitzplatz, which now houses the American Church in Berlin"

   "name": "Friedenau",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Rathaus Friedenau, Kirche zum Guten Hirten. Unlike many of the localities of Berlin which began as villages in the 13th century, Friedenau was founded in 1871. After the Franco-Prussian War, some 50,000 people moved to Berlin creating a housing crisis. To resolve this problem, a large parcel of land was purchased from the manor Deutsch-Wilmersdorf and it was intended that the area be developed as affordable housing. Friedenau’s name comes from the German words for peace (frieden) and meadow (au).  As Friedenau was a carefully planned community, it retains a uniform charm of late 19th and early 20th century architecture. The area is known for its buildings with small front gardens and the uniform layout of its streets. It is a quiet urban residential district, close to more popular nightlife areas. Friedenau is part of the southwestern suburbs, right at the border with the inner city Schöneberg district, separated by the Berlin Ringbahn and the BAB 100 motorway (Stadtring). It borders the Wilmersdorf locality in the west and Steglitz in the south. The streets and squares are laid out according to a geometric urban design with an almost complete assembly of Gründerzeit buildings, which survived the bombing of Berlin in World War II.The characteristic feature of Friedenau is the Carstenn figure, named after urban developer Johann Anton Wilhelm von Carsten. This symmetrical figure consists of an avenue dividing a circular road, which is delimited by four town squares. Some streets in Friedenau were renamed after rivers in Alsace-Lorraine to commemorate the annexation of this region into the German Empire. The majority of buildings in Friedenau date to the early 20th century. Therefore, the architectural styles are almost uniform. 185 buildings are protected as cultural heritage sites. Younger buildings do not necessarily match the surrounding cityscape, since the reconstruction efforts after World War II gave little consideration to the preservation of architectural uniformity.In 1871 it was founded as an affluent commuter town on the estates of the former Deutsch-Wilmersdorf manor. The German name Friedenau, referring to Frieden (peace) and the suffix -au meaning floodplains (hence floodplain of peace), was proposed by Hedwig Hähnel, wife of the architect Hermann Hähnel, in memory of the 1871 Peace of Frankfurt, which ended the Franco-Prussian War. It was adopted by Mr. Hähnel, then the director of the Landerwerb- und Bauverein auf Actien (inc.), which developed the real estate in the area.[2] When in 1874 the area constituted as an independent municipality within the Province of Brandenburg, the denotation had already been established and became the official municipal name. Friedenau opened its own non-denominational municipal cemetery, today's Städtischer Friedhof III, which soon grew too small. So in 1909 Friedenau bought a tract of land in Güterfelde (today a component of Stahnsdorf) as additional graveyard, with the first burial taking place in 1913. Friedenau's municipal construction councillor Hans Altmann designed for the cemetery a mourning chapel, an office, a gardener's house, a flower shop, benches and a fountain as well as a net of paths replicating the streets net in Friedenau. Since June 1913 the cemetery was accessible via the so-called cemetery train line ending at Stahnsdorf station. Friedenau joined with the town of Schöneberg in 1920 – under the latter's name – as the former 11th administrative borough of Greater Berlin. In the short time from 29 April to 30 June 1945, when the Red Army occupied all Berlin, it was a borough in its own right, until it was reunified with Schöneberg as one borough within the American Sector of West Berlin. The Güterfelde cemetery, since 1920 called Forest Cemetery of Schöneberg was operated since 1935 by Berlin's Borough of Wilmersdorf, called Wilmersdorf Forest Cemetery Güterfelde (German: Wilmersdorfer Waldfriedhof Güterfelde). After 1945 the cemetery happened to be in the Soviet Zone of Occupation and later in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), thus with the increasing Eastern interdiction of West Berlin the cemetery grew inaccessible for the Friedenauers. On 5 April 1986 a bomb exploded at the La Belle discothèque in a former cinema on Hauptstraße 78, killing a Turkish woman and two U.S. servicemen and injuring numerous people. A plaque marks the site."

   "name": "Tempelhof",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Tempelhofer Feld, Platz der Luftbrücke, Dorfkirche Tempelhof, UFA-Fabrik. Originally named Tempelhove, many scholars believe the Knights Templar founded a commandery (komturei), a small estate controlled by a military commander, in the area in the mid-13th century and it’s from the order that Tempelhof gets its name. The settlement consisted of a church and the estate and the surrounding area was developed by farmers from the Rhineland. When the Knights Templar order was abolished in 1312, Tempelhof was taken over by the knights of Saint John (called the Johanniter in Germany). The Johanniter controlled the area until 1435 when they sold the estate to the city of Berlin. Tempelhof remained a rural village outside of the urban areas of Berlin proper until the late 19th century when it was finally developed. A large piece of land, the Tempelhof Field (Tempelhofer Feld), was denoted as a parade ground for the military. The field later became an important place of aviation history and was eventually the location of the Tempelhof Airport (Flughafen Tempelhof). The airport was the location of the Berlin Airlift during the Berlin Blockade and outside of the grounds there is a memorial to the airmen who died in accidents during the airlift.  Today, Tempelhof is a mix of housing estates, apartment blocks, parks, industrial sites, and shopping centres. There are many parks and green spaces, particularly since 2008 when the Tempelhof Airport was decommissioned and turned into a public field making it a popular spot for those who love windsports. Most of the residential areas are in the western part of the locality. The northwest is primarily a settlement of small family homes with gardens and the southwest are apartment blocks. The southeast mainly consists of industrial areas along the Teltow Canal (Teltowkanal). Tempelhof is easily accessible by public transport and can be an affordable inner-city option for those looking for centrality on a budget. It is the location of the former Tempelhof Airport, one of the earliest commercial airports in the world. It is now deserted and shows as a blank spot on maps of Berlin. Attempts are being made to save the still-existing buildings. The Tempelhof locality is located in the south-central part of the city. Before Berlin's 2001 administrative reform, the area of Tempelhof, together with the localities of Mariendorf, Marienfelde, and Lichtenrade, constituted a borough of its own, also called Tempelhof. These localities grew from historic villages on the Teltow plateau founded in the early 13th century in the courseTempelhove was first mentioned in a 1247 deed issued at the Walkenried Abbey as a Komturhof (commander's court, the smallest holding entity of a military order) of the Knights Templar whose leadership and many fellow knights had been expelled from the Kingdom of Jerusalem on its downfall in 1291. The centre of the settlement, consisting of the church and the original estate, was fortified and originally completely surrounded by water. The Templars were joined by fifteen families of landless farmers' sons from the Rhine, who could not inherit any estate from their parents because of over-fragmentation of those estates. Legates of the Templars offered them fertile soil and the protec  of the German Ostsiedlung. After Pope Clement V officially abolished the Order of the Temple in 1312, the knights of Saint John (the Johanniter), backed by Margrave Waldemar of Brandenburg, took over the villages of Tempelhof, Mariendorf, and Marienfelde. In 1435, they sold their estates to the city of Berlin. n the early nineteenth century, Tempelhof was still a village outside Berlin proper and was the site of country excursions for the citizens of Berlin.[1] The northern parts of Tempelhof were incorporated as Berlin's Tempelhofer Vorstadt in 1861 and in 1920 became part of the Kreuzberg borough. Today, the former commandry (German: Komturei) is a chain of parks, called Bosepark, Kleiner Park, Alter Park, and Franckepark. Some of them still have ponds that were part of the artificial moat surrounding the village's center. One, the Krummer Pfuhl, located in the Franckepark, after being turned into public swimming baths in the nineteenth century, has completely dried out and is now an enclosed deer park. The original church, built from glacial boulders, was destroyed in the Second World War and was replaced with one built of ashlar or dressed stone with a timber-frame tower. The Tempelhof Studios were established in 1912 and functioned as film and later television studios."

   "name": "Mariendorf",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Volkspark Mariendorf, Adlermühle, Dorfkirche Mariendorf. Like neighbouring locality Marienfelde, Mariendorf (which translates as Mary’s Village) was created in the 13th century by the Knights Templar as a subsidiary village to the nearby commandery the Komturei Tempelhof. It was later sold to the city of Berlin and it remained a small village for many years. In 1800, Mariendorf only had a population of 162 residents. Moving into the late 19th century and the southern part of the locality was developed as a mansion colony (Villenkolonie) which greatly increased the area’s population. In 1913, the harness racing track (Trabennbahn) was opened and in 1924 a public park was developed (Volkspark Mariendorf).  Mariendorf has relatively low rents compared to the city average, but it is also rather remote and quiet. The northern part of the locality are mostly private garden allotments (Kleingartenanlage) and the rest of the area is largely a mix of single-family homes, apartment blocks, and to the west, industrial buildings.  Mariendorf was mentioned for the first time in a document of 1348, when it was held by the Bailiwick of Brandenburg of the Order of Saint John (the Johanniterorden). The Johanniter sold Mariendorf, together with Tempelhof and Marienfelde, to the city of Berlin and Coelln in 1435. In 1800, Mariendorf had 162 inhabitants.  Beginning in 1872, a Villenkolonie (mansion colony) was developed in the south end of Mariendorf, and by 1900 the village had 5,764 inhabitants. The Trabrennbahn (harness racing track) opened in 1913, and in 1920 Mariendorf became formally amalgamated into the greater city of Berlin. The Volkspark Mariendorf was developed in 1924. At the end of Second World War, Mariendorf became a part of the American zone of occupation. In 1946, Mariendorf's Eisenacher Straße was the site of a displaced persons´ camp which housed roughly 3,250 persons until 1948.  In 1966, an U-Bahn underground station was constructed to serve the district on line U6."

   "name": "Marienfelde",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Freizeitpark Marienfelde, Alt-Marienfelde, Dorfkirche Marienfelde. Marienfelde (Mary’s Field), like the similarly named Mariendorf, was a farming community developed by the Knights Templar. It was founded in the early 13th century and the local village church also originates from around that time. Marienfelde remained a small village for much of its history and only began to see an increase in population with the opening of the train station in 1875. In the late 19th century, a mansion colony was built called Neu Marienfelde, but much of this was severely damaged during World War II. After the war many houses and apartments were built and the area became characterized by its high-rise buildings and the housing estate of Waldsassener Straße.  Marienfelde is a quiet and relatively inexpensive area of Berlin which retains some of its village charm in the area of Alt-Marienfelde near the village church (Dorfkirche Marienfelde), one of the oldest buildings in Berlin. While much of the southeastern part of the locality comprises of industrial buildings, the rest of the district is a mix of apartment blocks, single family homes, and a large public park (Freizeitpark Marienfelde). The former village, incorporated according to the Greater Berlin Act of 1920, today is a mixed industrial and residential area. The medieval Angerdorf arose together with neighbouring Mariendorf during the German Ostkolonisation migration about 1220 AD, then affiliated with the Teltow estates held by the Knights Templar commandry at Tempelhof. A fieldstone church was erected around 1240 which, still preserved, is one of the oldest in the Berlin area. The settlement of Merghenvelde itself was first mentioned in a 1344 deed, after the Brandenburg lands of the Knights Templar had passed to the Order of Saint John. From 1435 onwards, the estates were held by the City of Berlin. Located in the southwestern suburbs of the Prussian capital, population increased from the mid-19th century on. The historic village centre was largely destroyed during the bombing of Berlin in World War II. Marienfelde is also known for a large refugee-processing center which operated during the cold war. The center, which opened in 1953, was the first stop for more than 1.5 million refugees fleeing communism in East Germany via West Berlin. Refugees arriving in West Berlin were sent to the center where they received medical treatment, food, identification papers, and housing until they could be permanently re-settled in the West. Even after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the center continued processing East German refugees until unification a year later. Today the center remains in use, processing ethnic Germans who are immigrating to Germany from the former Soviet Union."

   "name": "Lichtenrade",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Dorfkirche Lichtenrade, Mälzerei Lichtenrade Concentration Camp. Unlike the nearby settlements of Marienfelde, Tempelhof, and Mariendorf, Lichtenrade’s history does not begin with the settlement of Knights Templars, but with the German Eastern Expansion (Ostsiedlung) of the Margraves of Brandenburg. It was likely established in 1230, and was first mentioned in writing in 1375 as Lichtenrode. The locality was rural for much of its history, and did not develop beyond this until it was incorporated into the city of Berlin in 1920. During World War II, a branch of the Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp was opened in Lichtenrade and housed primarily Ukrainian prisoners of war. There is now a memorial for the victims of the camp on Bornhagenweg.Today, Lichtenrade is a green, suburban community primarily made up of single-family homes. The rental prices remain low, but it is a significant distance from the inner-city and is subsequently quieter than other areas of the district. Public transport can also be an issue, as only the eastern part of the locality has quick access to the S-Bahn. The locality was first mentioned in 1375, named Lichtenrode. Autonomous Prussian municipality of the former Teltow district, Lichtenrade was incorporated into Berlin in 1920, with the Greater Berlin Act. During World War II, a branch of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp was located in this locality.[1] After 1941, prisoners of war from Ukraine were interned in the camp. During the Cold War it was a part of West Berlin bordering with East Germany. Its long boundary with Brandenburg was surrounded by the Berlin Wall from 1961 to 1989. "

   "name": "Alt-Treptow",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Treptower Park, Sowjetisches Ehrenmal, Arena Berlin, Glashaus, Badeschiff, MS Hoppetosse, White Trash Fast Food. The area of Alt-Treptow has been the site of human occupation for thousands of years, and was the location of a settlement of Slavs from the 6th or 7th century. The name Treptow comes from the Slavic name for the river Trebow, whose name likely originates from the word Drewo which means hardwood. When the Germans took over the area in the 13th century, the area was predominantly used for fishing and beekeeping. Over time it expanded into a village, and in the 19th century became a popular daytrip location for Berliners due to its large number of cafes and beer gardens. In the late-19th century, Treptow became an important industrial area and during the world wars was important for developing armaments. Following World War II, Alt-Treptow became part of East Berlin and was the place of two important border crossings as it bordered the West Berlin districts of Kreuzberg and Neukölln. Recent years has seen Alt-Treptow rising in popularity due to its nearness to the trendy districts of Kreuzberg, Neukölln, and Friedrichshain. Rents have risen considerably recently due to this. It is a small district and about half of the area is comprised of parkland. The area is known for its bars and clubs and is considered rather alternative in nature, although there are quiet and more expensive areas such as the villa colony off of Puschkinallee. The locality, first inhabited in 6th century by Slavic peoples, was first mentioned in 1568 with the name of Trebow. It merged into Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act in 1920. From 1961 to 1989 its north and western borders were crossed by the Berlin Wall. From January 1, 2001 the former borough of Treptow, composed also by Plänterwald, Baumschulenweg, Niederschöneweide, Johannisthal, Adlershof, Altglienicke and Bohnsdorf, was disestablished to merge into the new Treptow-Köpenick borough.  Bordered in north by the Spree river it counts in its territory an islet named Insel der Jugend (Youth Island). "

   "name": "Plänterwald",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Eierhäuschen, Spreepark. Although it only became a district in its own right in 1997, Plänterwald, which derives its name from the German word for timber forest, was used as recreational area since the 19th century. It was also the location of the East German amusement park, the Spreepark, which opened in 1969 and had about 1.7 million visitors a year. Following the reunification it faced financial difficulties and closed in 2001, and is now restricted to the public. Only the western parts of the locality are inhabited, with the Plänterwald Park bordering the Spree to the east. The populated areas are comprised of small garden allotments and apartment buildings. The northwestern parts border the popular Treptower Park, and while there are no S or U-Bahn stops within the locality, there are multiple S-Bahn stations nearby. The name Plänterwald derives from the German word Plenterwald, referred to a timber forest. The 89 hectares of the forest were first economically used in 1760, and in 1969 the northern side became part of the Spreepark (better known as Cultural Park Plänterwald [2]). In 1920, as part of the former municipality of Treptow, it merged into Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act. Crossed by the Berlin Wall on its borders with Neukölln from 1961 to 1989, the locality became autonomous in 1997, separated from Alt-Treptow and Baumschulenweg."

   "name": "Baumschulenweg",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Baumschule Späth, Kirche Zum Vaterhaus. Initially part of the community of Treptow, Baumschulenweg was a sparsely populated rural area for much of its history. It was deforested from 1829 to 1840, and throughout the mid-19th century was developed by farmers. Due to the General German Agricultural Exhibition (Allgemeine Deutsche Landwirtschafliche Wanderausstellung) of 1894 and the Berlin Trade Fair (Berliner Gewerbeausstellung) or 1896, Treptow and surrounding areas were further developed, leading to several yellow and red brick houses which are now under monument protection. The world renowned Späth nursery also had a hand in developing the hamlet at that time. Following World War II, the locality came under the control of the Soviets, damaged properties were fixed and the nursery became the property of the state and became a center of botany. When Germany was reunified, several areas were developed for residential housing. With its nearness to the trendy district of Neukölln, Baumschulenweg can be a good choice for those searching for more rental options. The northeast of the locality is where the majority of the apartment blocks are located, and they are well connected to the S-Bahn with bus lines. The rest of the locality is mainly made up of small garden allotments (Kleingartenanlagen) and a small community of single-family homes. While the nightlife options are not nearly as vast as in nearby neighborhoods, along Baumschulenstraße are a number of shops providing all of the necessities and it is only a few short stops away from several more trendy areas."

   "name": "Johannisthal",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Landschaftspark Johannisthal/Adlershof, Altes Rathaus Johannisthal, Kirche Johannisthal Founded by colonists from the Palatinate in the mid-18th century, Johannisthal was a small community until a station of the Berlin-Görlitz railway was opened in 1880. In 1909, Germany’s first airfield was opened in Johannisthal and neighboring Adlershof, and many aviation pioneers began their careers there. Following World War I, as part of the Treaty of Versailles, the construction of aircraft in Germany was limited and a film studio was built in the factory halls of the airfield and it became one of the most successful film studios in Germany. Johannisthal became part of Berlin in 1920, and following World War II it became part of the Soviet controlled East Berlin. In 1995, the airfield was closed and it became a park open to the public. Since the closing of the airfield, there has been much new development in the locality, with a large community of single-family homes built on part of the vacated land. Apartment buildings line Sterndamm, and range from high-rises to early-20th century buildings. In general, the apartment buildings tend to be lower than in the inner-city, typically not exceeding three stories. Prices tend to be a little higher than in some of the other neighboring localities, but are still competitive compared to that of the inner-city. While there are no S-Bahn stations within the locality, there are several on the eastern edge which are easily accessible by tram or bus. The first mention of the locality was on November 16, 1753. In 1880 it was served by a train station on the Berlin-Görlitzer Eisenbahn and in 1884 it was awarded by the title of Bad (bath), becoming Bad Johannisthal. From 1905 to 1906 it was built the town hall and in 1920 the town merged into Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act. As part of East Berlin bordering with Neukölln (West Berlin), its borders were crossed by the Berlin Wall from 1961 to 1989. Germany's first airport, located between Johannisthal and Adlershof, the Johannisthal Air Field, was opened on September 26, 1909[2]and officially closed in 1995. Located in the south-eastern side of the city, not too far from the river Spree, Johannisthal borders with the localities of Baumschulenweg, Niederschöneweide, Adlershof, Altglienicke and Rudow (this one in Neukölln district). Its urban park is the Königsheide."

 {
   "name": "Niederschöneweide",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Stubenrauchbrücke, Alte Feuerwache, Michael-Brückner-Haus. Originally called Schöneweide (Beautiful Pasture), Niederschöneweide was first mentioned in 1598. It was a small rural community, and by 1800 there were only 42 residents. This quickly changed as a wide variety of different businesses developed along the Spree throughout the 19th century, and towards the end of the century several beer gardens and restaurants also emerged making it a popular entertainment destination. These areas disappeared as industrialization of the locality increased and several tenement houses were built to accommodate the influx of workers to the area. During World War II, the area was important for the armaments industry in Germany and was the location of a forced labor camp. Following the war the locality became part of Soviet controlled East Berlin, and the factories were nationalized. With reunification, this process was reversed and many of the factories were closed leading to an economic downturn in the area. Today, Niederschöneweide is a small locality with an industrial flair. Many of the apartment buildings were built at the turn of the 20th century and have a similar style to those found in the inner-city, but tend to not exceed three stories in height. Industrial buildings can be found along the northern banks of the Spree, but to the south the locality is far more residential and includes a small community of single-family homes. Rental prices are rather average for the district, but it is possible to find good deals. The real strength of Niederschöneweide is its plethora of public transport options and ease of access to a number of popular areas in the eastern reaches of Berlin, both urban and rural. This can make it ideal for those searching for the best of both worlds. First mentioned in 1598 as Schöne Weyde, it became an autonomous municipality in 1850, growing as an industrial town at the end of 19th century. In 1920 it merged into Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act. Between 1949 and 1990 it was part of East Berlin, and new residential complexes were established at Oberspree. All the industries on the territory were converted into Volkseigener Betrieb (VEB), the state-owned enterprises.[1] In 1994, after German reunification, it started a plan for a redevelopment of many contaminated grounds on many areas, inheritance of the heavy industrial era. They must be cleared away and detoxicated with high costs. Located in the south-eastern side of the city and crossed by the river Spree, Niederschöneweide borders with the localities of Oberschöneweide, Plänterwald, Baumschulenweg, Johannisthal, Adlershof and Köpenick. A bit of the urban parks Köllnische Heide, situated in Adlershof, belongs to the quarter."

   "name": "Altglienicke",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Pfarrkirche Altglienicke, Wasserwerk Altglienicke, Evangelischer Friedhof Altglienicke. Altglienicke was founded around 1230 as a German street village (Straßendorf). First mentioned in 1375, it was originally called Glinik, which originates from the Slavic word for clay. It was a small village and often had new owners until it was bought by the Brandenburg Elector Frederick, who made it into an outlying estate of the city of Köpenick. By 1920 there were more than 5,000 inhabitants, and the village was incorporated into the city of Berlin. Throughout the 20th century there were several new developments which eventually raised the population up to around 26,000 people.A suburban locality close to the Schönefeld Airport, Altglienicke is an inexpensive option for those seeking cheap rents with good public transport connections. It is densely populated with single-family homes and attached houses, but there are also several areas of modern apartment buildings (Neubau) available in the southern reaches of the locality. As it is close to the airport, there is a significant chance for flyover noise. It is a sleepy suburb without many nightlife or shopping options, but with the S-Bahn it is relatively simple to reach areas with more options. The village of Glinik was first mentioned in 1375. The Berlin Wall cut through Altglienicke (in East Berlin) and Rudow (in West Berlin) from 1961 until 1990. It was also the location for an joint American and British intelligence operation."

   "name": "Adlershof",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Anna-Seghers-Gedenkstätte, Verklärungskirche, Aerodynamischer Park. Unlike most of the surrounding villages which developed as rural farming estates, Adlershof began as a cottage colony whose population worked as day laborers in nearby villages in towns. As the town of Köpenick grew, so too did Adlershof. Over the years Adlershof became a village in its own right and fertile farming lands on the outskirts were developed. In the mid-19th century, a stop on the Berlin-Görlitz railway was built in Adlershof which made it a prime location for industrial development. The population increased exponentially by the early 20th century, and in 1909 with the opening of the Johannisthal Air Field (Flugplatz Johannisthal), Adlershof became internationally known as the center of Germany’s aviation and aerospace development. Following World War II, Adlershof became part of the Soviet controlled East Berlin, and was the location of the Academy of Sciences of the GDR (Akademie der Wissenschaften der DDR) and the East German National Television. The locality remains to this day an important center of scientific research in Germany. Most of the southern part of the locality is industrial in nature, with the majority of the residential areas located on either side of Dörpfeldstraße. The rental prices are in line with the other suburban areas outside of the ring of the inner-city of Berlin. Adlershof is well connected to the city with tram, bus, and S-Bahn, and is a short hop to the forests and lakes of the nearby locality of Grünau. On the southwestern side of Adlershof now is built the new City of Science, Technology and Media (WISTA). The local management seeks to establish the word Adlershof as a synonym for WISTA, ignoring the traditional center of Adlershof. A part of the area known today as the City of Science, Technology and Media, was once known as the Johannisthal Air Field. Germany's first motorized aircraft took off from here at the beginning of the 20th century. Albatros, Fokker, Rumpler and Wright made Adlershof-Johannisthal famous. In 1912 the German Experimental Institute for Aviation (Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt – DVL) made Adlershof its headquarters. Laboratories, motor test beds, wind tunnels and hangars were erected in the 20s and 30s and are historical landmarks today. Adlershof is particularly well known for a series of competitions between various aviation firms' fighter aircraft designs that were held there starting in 1918. This was the first time the pilots themselves were asked for their input into the selection process, they resoundingly asked for higher speed as opposed to maneuverability, which the Idflieg had always assumed was most important. The first of these contests, held in January 1918, led to the Fokker D.VII winning the competition and going on to become one of Germany's most feared planes. A second competition in May and June led to the acceptance of several of the main contest entries, the Pfalz D.XII, Fokker E.V, Junkers D.I and Siemens-Schuckert D.IV, the later of which is considered by many to be Germany's best design of the war. All three were put into production largely in order to make up for the slow production of the Fokkers, although only the Pfalz design could be found in any number. A final war-time contest in October was too late to have any effect on the war effort. Even after the war the process continued, with a fourth competition between February and May 1919, but the signing of the Versailles Treaty ended all military aircraft work in Germany and leading to the dissolution of the Luftstreitkräfte in May 1920. After World War II, the airport was closed and from then on three institutions determined Adlershof's destiny: The Ministry of State Security (MfS) stationed its 12,000 strong Guard Regiment there. In 1952 East Germany's National Television began broadcasting from Adlershof. And the East German Academy of Science was established with nine scientific institutes in the fields of physics and chemistry. Scientific Equipment Engineering with its approx. 1,700 workers developed and produced a majority of East Germany's research equipment. A substantial portion of the research done at the Academy institutes was notable for its close connection with the industry, allowing the scientists to engage in worldwide networks. Adlershof produced many known products and inventions, such as ultra-short pulse lasers, time-resolved optical spectroscopy and space diagnosis devices. Other things like trifocals and contraceptive pills were also invented here. In 1989 over 5,600 people were working in Adlershof, more than half the R&D capacity of the whole Science Academy. After German reunification, the guard regiment was dissolved and the fate of the Academy was sealed by the German Unification Treaty: The research facilities of the Academy were subjected to an evaluation marathon by the German Council of Science and Humanities (Wissenschaftsrat), which established that there were about 1,500 Academy employees who ought to be placed in new research structures. For the rest of the former employees, it was recommended that they either find new jobs or start their own companies. So of the 250 newly founded companies, approx 100 were founded by ex-academy workers. Today almost 90 per cent of the companies co-operate with at least one partner, and 60 per cent with three or more partners at the site. Eight of the 12 research institutes now located in Adlershof and financed by Berlin and the Federal Republic of Germany are directly descended from the former GDR Academy of Sciences at the beginning of 1992 and integrated into the Federal German research landscape. They continued their activity under the responsibility of other bodies for example under the Max Planck Society, or affiliated to large research establishments like the Joint Initiative of Non-University Research Institutions in Adlershof  - IGAFA. In September 1991 the State of Berlin founded the Adlershof Development Society (EGA), from which WISTA-MANAGEMENT GMBH emerged in 1994. In 1992 the Senate of Berlin decided to establish an integrated scientific and business landscape on the Adlershof site and made building investments amounting to about 230 million euros. The goal was to bring together the synergies from science and industry, innovation to market. To encourage innovative businesses to settle here, modern specialised centres were established on the premises, some in reconstructed old buildings, and others in new buildings with spectacular architecture. The first was the Innovation and Business Incubation Centre IGZ in 1991, followed by the Centre for Photonics and Optical Technologies, the Centre for Environmental, Bio and Energy Technology, the Centre for Information and Media Technology, and the Centre for Materials and Microsystems Technology. A Service-Centre and the East-West Co-operation Centre for Middle and Eastern European entrepreneurs top off the profile. Up to the end of the year 2000 WISTA-MANAGEMENT GMBH had made investments to the amount of approximately 325 million euros. At the end of 1991 the decision was made to relocate the mathematics and natural science faculties of the Humboldt University of Berlin to Adlershof. In 1998 the Department of Computer Science moved to Adlershof, followed by the Departments of Mathematics in 2000, Chemistry in 2001, and Physics, Geography and Psychology in 2003. One of the most modern libraries in Europe, the new Information and Communication Centre Erwin Schrödinger-Zentrum, is a computing centre, library and a technology transfer point which can be used jointly by both university and non-university institutions alike. Adlershof is the location of Am Studio 20D, the venue for the European League of Legends Championship Series from 2015 to the present."

   "name": "Bohnsdorf",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Dorfkirche Bohnsdorf. Likely the result of the combination of an old Slavic village with German settlers in the 13 th century, Bohnsdorf nonetheless has a long history as a rural community. During the Thirty Years War (1618 – 1648) around three-quarters of the population were killed and the medieval church was severely damaged. It was repaired, but in 1755 was replaced by a new brick church built on the town square. When settlers arrived from Southwestern Germany in the mid-18th century, a new settlement was established under the name Neu-Bohnsdorf. These two communities later joined in 1865. Bohnsdorf joined Berlin in 1920 and following World War II, the locality became a part of East Germany. Bohnsdorf is a densely settled suburban community very close to the Brandenburg airport of Schönefeld. It is mainly comprised of single-family homes, although there are some multi-family residences and apartment buildings. While there are many S-Bahn stations on the outskirts of the locality, the majority of the locality is served by bus and the highway 117 divides the historic town center from the majority of the residential districts. Bohnsdorf borders the beautiful locality of Grünau, and the forests and rivers are only a short distance away making it a good choice for those seeking easy access to nature. The locality was first mentioned in 1375 with the name of Benistorp. "

   "name": "Oberschöneweide",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Christuskirche, Funkhaus Nalepastraße, Volkspark Wuhlheide. A small farming estate for much of its history, Oberschöneweide remained underdeveloped until the late 19th century. This was primarily the result of its isolation from train stations, something that did not change until a chain ferry was built across the Spree, later followed by a wooden bridge in 1889. Around this time, several factories opened along the banks of the Spree. During World War I, it became a center of the armaments industry, leading to it developing into a large working class neighborhood. It was incorporated into Berlin in 1920, and during the Nazi era, it was stronghold of resistance against Nazism. It was heavily bombed during World War II, and following the war became a part of East Berlin. Following the reunification, many of the factories were closed or privatized which brought an end to much of the traditional industry in the area. Like its neighbor Niederschöneweide, Oberschöneweide is populated primarily along the banks of the Spree. With historic industrial buildings line the river, with a mixture of three-story apartment buildings spreading out to the west. To the north of the industrial area, still along the banks of the Spree, is a large community of small garden allotments (Kleingartenanlagen) and to the west is the large Wuhlheide Park (Volkspark Wuhlheide). The area is known for its rush hour traffic which can cause significant noise. Rental prices in this locality can be significantly lower than in neighboring localities of Treptow-Köpenick. While there are no S-Bahn stops within Oberschöneweide, it is only a short distance from other stations with tram and bus. First mentioned in 1598 as Schöne Weyde, it became an industrial town at the end of the 19th century. In 1920 it merged into Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act. The Berlin territorial reform with effect from 1 April 1938 also affected the districts Treptow and Köpenick. The districts Oberschöneweide and Wuhlheide were removed from the district Treptow and incorporated into the district Köpenick. In the Nazi era Oberschöneweide developed into a stronghold of resistance against National Socialism, which despite constant arrests and death sentences could not be broken. The resistance cells were the most numerous in the years 1942-1944. The factories in Oberschoeneweide remained the foundation of the illegal Berlin KPD headquarters. The mass recalls from 1941 resulted in a lack of staff in the factories. In order to maintain production, more and more forced laborers from all over Europe were employed. Several barracks camps were built for forced laborers in Wuhlheide. Here was also the same named, the Gestapo subordinate Berlin work education camp. More than 6,000 foreign forced laborers worked in Kabelwerk Oberspree and other factories located in the AEG factory complex, as well as female inmates of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp in 1944/1945. In the air raids of the Allies on June 21 and August 6, 1944, Oberschöneweide was covered with a dense bomb carpet, while the Kabelwerk Wilhelminenhof heavily destroyed. The attack of February 26, 1945 met Oberschöneweide once again in its entirety. Among the casualties were many foreign forced laborers. On April 16, 1945, during the Battle of Berlin (one of the last battles of World War II in Europe), before the German troops left Oberschöneweide, they tried to stop Red Army at the bridges Kaisersteg and Treskowbrücke. On April 24 the zone was in the hands of the 8th Guards Army of the Soviet Union. The administrative division of Greater Berlin by the Allied victorious powers Oberschöneweide fell with the other districts of the district of Köpenick under Soviet control. As everywhere else in the Soviet occupation zone, all non-destroyed means of production were dismantled and brought to the Soviet Union in Oberschöneweide. It followed the expropriation of the industrial enterprises, they were later converted into state-owned enterprises. The Queen Elisabeth Hospital served Soviet troops as a military hospital from October 1945 and remained there until the complete withdrawal of Soviet / Russian troops from Germany in 1994. In the 1950s, the radio house Nalepastraße was built. Here, all the radio programs of the GDR were produced centrally by the radio of the GDR. Due to the changing economy since the reunification on 3 October 1990, many companies have suffered layoffs, closures and privatisations. This was the end of the traditional industrial location. The South Korean industrial giant Samsung operated on the Samsung SDI in Oberschöneweide until the end of 2005, a production site for tube TVs and mobile devices. He gave up the location despite the receipt of subsidies in the millions of subsidies by the state of Berlin due to sales problems and inefficiency. The industrial buildings Oberschöneweides are listed since 1991 and are a focal point of the Berlin industrial heritage. Many small craft enterprises have settled on the industrial estates. The traditional medium-sized companies include Silicon Sensor GmbH (formed by the spin-off of the former television electronics factory) and BAE Batterien GmbH (at the location of Accumulatoren Fabrik Aktiengesellschaft, AFA). In 2006, the former AEG terrain was redeveloped into the HTW Berlin, Hochschule für Technik und Wirtschaft Berlin. As of 2017, there are 18,000 students. During rush hours, several roads were congested at many times which is at Spree-, Edison- and Siemensstraße. As a result, the surrounding residential areas are affected, which led to the inclusion of the entire area in the noise reduction planning in Berlin. To relieve the congestion, two more bridges are planned. The Minna Todenhagen Bridge is part of the southeastern connection, to be completed in the first phase. It leads east to the Britzer canal over the Spree and connects the Rummelsberg Road, over the Minna Todenhagen Road with the Köpenicker country road and fast road on Niederschöneweider area. On February 27, 2012, the plan approval decision was issued, construction began in 2013. The construction period should be three years. On 21 December 2017, the road was opened to traffic. The other bridge, Wilhelminenhofbrücke, whose construction project is still in planning, is to lead to the eastern extension of Wilheminenhofstraße over the Spree to the Schnellerstraße in the Oberspree. Located in the south-eastern side of the city and crossed by the river Spree, Oberschöneweide borders with the localities of Plänterwald, Baumschulenweg, Niederschöneweide, Köpenick, Karlshorst and Rummelsburg (both in Lichtenberg district). Its urban park is the Wuhlheide, in which is located the ridable miniature railway Berliner Parkeisenbahn (BPE), used during the East German period by the Young Pioneer Organisation."

   "name": "Köpenick",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Rathaus Köpenick, Schloß Köpenick. With a long history as a Slavic settlement, Köpenick is the Germanization of the original Slavic name Copnic. It was first mentioned in 1210 as Copenic, and it was the location of a Slavic castle since 800 AD. This castle was conquered in 1245 and since then belonged to the Margraves of Brandenburg. During the Thirty Years War (1618 – 1648), Köpenick was devastated and by the end of the war only twelve residents remained. The Köpenick Castle (Köpenicker Burg) was replaced in 1558 with an elaborate hunting lodge. In the late 18th century, Köpenick became important once again due to its prominent role in the textile and silk trade. It was developed throughout the late 19th century with modern tenement suburbs and industrial enterprises which contributed to its economic strength. It was incorporated into Berlin in 1920. In April of 1945, Köpenick was taken over by the Red Army and it remained a part of the Soviet controlled East Berlin until the German reunification. Köpenick is a densely settled suburb of Berlin with good public transport connections and plenty of nearby open space. The southeastern part of the locality is a large forest with walking trails and access to the lake Großer Müggelsee, a popular recreational lake. At the junction where the Spree turns into the lake Müggelspree and the Dahme is the oldest part of Köpenick which is comprised of several old buildings. Of particular importance is the town hall (Rathaus Köpenick) where on 16 October 1906 the unemployed shoemaker Wilhelm Voigt masqueraded as a Prussian military officer, rounded up a number of soldiers under his command, and confiscated more than 4,000 marks of the town’s treasury. The story of the Hauptmann von Köpenick (The Captain of Köpenick) has later inspired theater plays, movies and musicals. The surrounding sprawl of Köpenick has a wide range of different residential buildings such as 19th century tenement houses, single-family homes, and modern apartment buildings. Köpenick is more urban than many of the surrounding localities and has more shopping and nightlife options as a result, but is still significantly quieter than areas closer to the city center of Berlin. Rental prices can be significantly lower than other localities which have led to its increase popularity in recent years. Köpenick is a historic town and locality (Ortsteil) that is situated at the confluence of the rivers Dahme and Spree in the south-east of the German capital city of Berlin. It was formerly known as Copanic and then Cöpenick, only officially adopting the current spelling in 1931. It is known for the famous imposter Hauptmann von Köpenick. Prior to its incorporation into Berlin in 1920, Köpenick was an independent town. It then became a borough of Berlin, with an area of 128 km2 (49 sq mi), making it Berlin's largest borough. In Berlin's 2001 administrative reform, the borough of Köpenick was merged with that of Treptow to create the current borough of Treptow-Köpenick. A large percentage of Köpenick's area is covered with forests and water, most notably the Müggelsee lake. The historic town lies in the centre of the Berlin Urstromtal meltwater valley at the confluence of the rivers Dahme and Spree. Shortly before its conflux with the Spree, the Schlossinsel lies on the Dahme, a small island with Köpenick Castle. The Spree connects Köpenick with the Müggelsee and the Berlin city centre. The Oder–Spree Canal links the Dahme, at nearby Schmöckwitz, with the Oder river, at Eisenhüttenstadt, thus providing a navigable connection between Köpenick and the Oder. Köpenick is sometimes called the green lungs of Berlin (Grüne Lunge Berlins). The Müggelberge hills in the south-east of Köpenick reach 115 m (377 ft), making them the highest natural point of Berlin. Köpenick had a long history as an independent town. In the 12th century it was the capital of a Slavonic duchy. Its first known mentioning as a stronghold dates back to a 1209 deed issued by Margrave Conrad II of Lusatia, then under the name Copanic (from Old Slavic: Kopanica). The place gained town privileges in 1232. It is therefore considered older than Berlin-Cölln, which was first mentioned in a 1237 deed. For the most part of Köpenick's history, the town was known as Cöpenick. The former Slavic castle from about 800 was conquered by the Ascanian margraves John I and Otto III of Brandenburg in 1245, defeating their rivals Margrave Henry III of Meissen and the Archbishop of Magdeburg territory. In 1631, during the Thirty Years' War, the emissaries of George William, Elector of Brandenburg met at Köpenick - then some distance outside Berlin - with the approaching army of Gustavus Adolphus, King of Sweden, in a vain effort to stop the ongoing devastation of Brandenburg. In 1906, a shoemaker called Wilhelm Voigt masqueraded as a Prussian officer and took over the town hall of Köpenick. Carl Zuckmayer perpetuated the incident in his play The Captain of Köpenick, the model for several films and television shows. Under the terms of the Greater Berlin Act of 1920, Köpenick became a borough of Berlin, with an area of 128 km2 (49 sq mi), making it Berlin's largest borough. Besides the locality of Köpenick, the former borough included the localities of Oberschöneweide, Grünau, Schmöckwitz, Müggelheim, Rahnsdorf and Friedrichshagen. In 1931, the current name was officially adopted. During World War II, it has been recently revealed that Koepnick served as one of a multitude of Nazi torture sites: A former prison in the Koepenick neighborhood of Berlin was the site of the worst violence in Berlin in '33. A total of 24 people were killed here, and around Koepenick, over a five-day period in June. It's known as the Week of Blood. The Koepenick Prison has been turned into a museum, and in 2013, opened a big exhibition to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Week of Blood, and the Nazi rise to power. During the Cold War, Köpenick was part of East Berlin. In Berlin's 2001 administrative reform, the borough of Köpenick was merged with that of Treptow to create the current borough of Treptow-Köpenick. Until 2002 a large radio facility for MW and FM was located near the Uhlenhorst neighbourhood, including a 248 m (814 ft) self-radiating radio mast, which was insulated against earth. The FM services of this facility were moved to the Fernsehturm at Alexanderplatz and the AM transmitters were moved to a new aerial mast at Zehlendorf bei Oranienburg. Köpenick PalaceThe palace (Schloss Köpenick) was originally built in 1558 as a hunting lodge by order of Elector Joachim II Hector of Brandenburg. The building in a Renaissance style was located on the river island at the site of the former medieval fort. Joachim II died here in 1571. In 1631 it served as the headquarters of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, where he - without results - asked his brother-in-law Elector George William for assistance in the Thirty Years' War. Frederick I of Prussia had the lodge rebuilt and enlarged from 1677 and lived here together with his first wife Elizabeth Henrietta of Hesse-Kassel. In 1730 Frederick II of Prussia, then Crown Prince, and his friend Hans Hermann von Katte faced the court-martial for desertion at Schloss Köpenick. Today the castle surrounded by a small park serves as a museum of decorative art, run by the Berlin State Museums.The so-called Köpenicker Sommer (Summer festival of Köpenick) is an annual summer street festival which features music, shows and a festival procession with the Captain of Köpenick (Hauptmann von Köpenick)."

   "name": "Friedrichshagen",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Großer Müggelsee, Berliner Bürgerbräu, Christophoruskirche Friedrichshagen, Naturtheater Friedrichshagen. Bohemian and Silesian cotton spinners formed Friedrichshagen in 1753 at the order of Friedrich II of Prussia. They operated a cotton mill and made their living in winter months by being broom makers. It was a small community, and a village church was built only in 1800. In 1849, the station Friedrichshagen was opened on the Niederschlesisch-Märkische Railway which ran from Berlin to Frankfurt (Oder). This helped develop Friedrichshagen into a residential suburb popular for summer tourists who enjoyed the popular lake Müggelsee. In 1888 a larger waterworks was built to provide water to East Berlin. By 1920, when it was incorporated in Berlin, Friedrichshagen had almost 15,000 residents. Known as an artist village (Künstlerdorf), Friedrichshagen has a long history of attracting creative types during the summer months. This tradition continues today and there are many galleries promoting the work of artists from all over Europe. The northern part of the locality is mostly forests with walking trails, and to the south is the lake Großer Müggelsee. There is a wide mix of different residential homes in Friedrichshagen, including many apartment houses. Depending on the location, rental prices can be quite inexpensive, although prices do rise considerably in more trendy areas such as near the water. The colony of Friedrichsgnade was founded on May 29, 1753 by King Frederick II of Prussia.[1][2] Autonomous Prussian municipality of the former Niederbarnim district until 1920, it merged into Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act.[3] From 1949 to 1990, like the rest of the borough of Köpenick, it was part of East Berlin. Located in the south-eastern suburb of Berlin, Friedrichshagen borders with the Brandenburger municipalities of Hoppegarten (in Märkisch-Oderland district), and Schöneiche (in Oder-Spree). It is also bounded by the Berliner localities of Köpenick and Rahnsdorf. The residential area is surrounded in north by a big portion of the Berliner Stadtforst (city forest), and in south by the river Müggelspree (tributary of the Spree), and by the western side of Müggelsee, the biggest lake in Berlin."

   "name": "Rahnsdorf",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Woltersdo\trfer Straßenbahn, Triglaw Brücke, Dorfkirche Rahnsdorf. Originally a Slavic fishing village, Rahnsdorf was taken over by German settlers sometime in the 13th century. Rahnsdorf was first documented in 1375 as Radenstorf. It was controlled by Köpenick Castle (Burg Köpenick) and provided the castle with fish and other resources. It was a very small community and in 1800 it still had only 20 villagers. In 1872, the village was completely destroyed in a fire and subsequently rebuilt and soon became a villa colony for wealthy Berliners. In 1920, when Rahnsdorf was incorporated into Berlin, there were 2,700 inhabitants. In 1926, a residential and cottage colony called New Venice (Neu-Venedig) was built which was distinct due to the interconnecting canals. While well-connected to Berlin via S-Bahn, Rahnsdorf is a quiet suburban community surrounded by forest on the Berlin-Brandenburg border. It is mostly made up of single-family homes, making rental opportunities limited. That being said, the rental prices are considerably lower than other suburban areas of Berlin. There are many walking trails to be enjoyed in the area and popular beaches on the lake Müggelsee. The locality was first mentioned in 1375, originally created as fishermen's village, which has its own church. After 1872, when it burned down almost completely, it was rebuilt. In 1902 the Villenkolonie of Wilhelmshagen was built in the east of the village with Tabor Church. In 1920 Rahnsdorf merged into the city of Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act and from 1949 to 1990 it was part of East Berlin. Located in the south-eastern suburb of Berlin, Rahnsdorf is the easternmost locality of the city. The easternmost point is represented by Springeberg, a ground located in front of Falkensee lake, bordering with Woltersdorf and Erkner, two municipalities of Oder-Spree district, Brandenburg. Similar to an exclave it is linked to Berliner mainland with a road (Woltersdorfer Landstraße) forming a strip, as in Steinstücken. The other municipality bordering with Rahnsdorf is Schöneiche, also part of Oder-Spree. Another peculiarity of Rahnsdorfer borders with Brandenburg is represented by Landjägerallee, a road parallel to railway that forms a thin and long strip belonging to Erkner surrounded by Berliner territory. The localities of Treptow-Köpenick bordering with Rahnsdorf are Friedrichshagen, Köpenick and Müggelheim. Surrounded by a big portion of the Berliner Stadtforst (city forest), Rahnsdorf counts 2 lakes in its territory: the eastern portion of Müggelsee (the biggest lake in Berlin), and the western one of Dämeritzsee. Between the Müggelspree river, an affluent of the Spree representing the border with Müggelheim, and the old town, it is located Neu-Venedig (New Venice), a residential settlement so named because it is crossed by numerous artificial canals."

   "name": "Grünau",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Tribüne der Regattastrecke Grünau, Gesellschaftshaus Grünau, Vergnügungsetablissement Riviera. Originally named Grüne Aue or Green Meadow, Grünau was founded in the mid-18th century by settlers from Southwestern Germany. The settlement was sparsely populated for much of its early history and in 1800 had only 56 inhabitants. Eventually a boatbuilding trade began, but it was with the opening of the train stop of the Berlin-Görlitz railway that Grünau finally began to see development as Berlin residents came due to the recreational opportunities in the area. In 1881, the Berliner Regatta-Verein (Berlin Regatta Club) opened and soon many restaurants, boathouses, and rowing clubs came to the area. In the late 19th century, Grünau developed as a villa colony for wealthy Berliners and by 1900 there were 25,000 inhabitants. In 1920, it was incorporated into the city of Berlin and during the 1936 Olympics the rowing and canoeing events were held here. Grünau still continues to be a popular location for those interested in boating, canoeing, and rowing with many clubs scattering the shore of the Dahme. It is a quiet community with an extensive forest with walking trails in the southern part of the locality. Most homes are villas or single or multiple family homes. It is well connected to Berlin via S-Bahn, Bus, and Tram, and the rental prices are considerably less expensive than other suburban communities of Berlin. During 1747 and 1753 some settlements were founded by Frederick II of Prussia, as Müggelheim, Friedrichshagen and Grünau itself. The village, founded in 1749, was first mentioned in 1754 with the name of Grüne Aue. Until 1920 it was a Prussian municipality of the former district of Teltow, merged into Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act. For the 1936 Summer Olympics, the city hosted the canoeing and rowing events at the regatta course on the Langer See. Located in the south-eastern suburb of Berlin, Grünau is bounded (in south-west) by the Brandenburger town of Schönefeld (in Dahme-Spreewald district). The Berliner bordering localities are Bohnsdorf, Altglienicke, Adlershof, Köpenick, Müggelheim and Schmöckwitz. The quarter is surrounded by the Berliner Stadtforst and traversed by the river Dahme (tributary of the Spree) in the southern shore. In the lake Langer See, formed on the river, the islet of Großer Rohrwall belongs to Grünau."

   "name": "Müggelheim",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Gosener Wiesen, Müggelspreewiesen. Settled in 1747 by a group of 20 families from Odernheim am Glan in Southwestern Germany, Müggelheim remained a small village until the 20th century. In 1920, when it was incorporated into Berlin during the Greater Berlin Act, it was the smallest rural community to join the city with only 186 residents. This population soon expanded as Berliners built weekend homes there taking advantage of the pleasures of the quiet forest and nearby lake. Development continued during World War II when many Berliners whose homes were destroyed by bombings built their homes in the outskirts for safety. By 1955, there were almost 5,000 residents, and over the years it has expanded to more than 6,000. Müggelheim is a quiet village of single-family homes surrounded by forest. It is far removed from the center of Berlin and is only accessible by bus or car. There are few rental opportunities in the community, but what is available is of average price for Berlin. The great draws of Müggelheim are the surrounding forest with walking trails and the closeness to a number of rivers and lakes. The village was founded on June 1, 1747, by 20 families from Odernheim am Glan, in Rhineland-Palatinate.[1] By 1920 it was still an autonomous municipality, the lesser-populated one (186 inhabitants) merging into the German capital with the Greater Berlin Act. Müggelheim, surrounded by the Berliner Stadtforst,[3] lies in the southeastern suburbs of Berlin, at the borders with the Brandenburg municipalities of Erkner and Gosen-Neu Zittau, Oder-Spree district. It borders on the Berlin localities of Rahnsdorf, Köpenick, Grünau and Schmöckwitz. The lakes Seddinsee and Langer See are the southern borders of the locality, which has within its limits three other lakes, the Große Krampe, a little portion of the Müggelsee (named Kleiner Müggelsee), and the little Bauersee."

   "name": "Schmöckwitz",
   "description": "Remarkable places: Dorfkirche Berlin-Schmöckwitz, Seddinsee, Zeuthener See. The southernmost locality in Berlin, Schmöckwitz was originally a Slavic fishing and beekeeping village. The name likely comes from a Slavic word for a nearby body of water, and it has been suggested it is from the word smokowic meaning snake stream, due to the meandering course of the nearby water. The village came into German possession around 1230, and was used to provide fish and honey for Köpenick Castle (Burg Köpenick). Much of the village was destroyed in a fire during the Thirty Years War (1618 – 1648). It was rebuilt and remained a small village until the 19th century when the first factories (for glue and cotton) were built. In 1920, Schmöckwitz was incorporated into Berlin, and following World War II it was part of East Berlin. While quite remote from the rest of Berlin, Schmöckwitz is a quaint locality of single-family homes with excellent access to nature. It is comprised of several small communities separated from one another by forest and rivers. It borders Brandenburg and is close neighbors with the suburban community of Eichwalde. Schöckwitz is only directly accessible by tram and bus, but the nearby Eichwalde is connected to the S-Bahn. It is a quiet community, far removed from the hectic urban lifestyle of the center of Berlin. The locality was founded in 1375 with the name of Smekewitz. In 1920 it merged into the city of Berlin with the Greater Berlin Act and from 1949 to 1990 it was part of East Berlin. Located in south-eastern suburb of the city, Schmöckwitz represents the southernmost locality of Berlin, with its southernmost point at Rauchfangswerder, a little peninsula between the lakes of Zeuthener See (on Dahme river) and Großer Zug which represents, also with the lakes Krossinsee and Wernsdorfer See, the borders of Schmöckwitz with Brandenburg. The bordering municipalities are Gosen-Neu Zittau (in Oder-Spree district), Königs Wusterhausen (with the civil parishes of Wernsdorf and Ziegenhals), Eichwalde (also with Miersdorfer Werder) and Zeuthen, all of them in Dahme-Spreewald district. The bordering localities within Berlin are Müggelheim and Grünau. The first is separated by the lakes Seddinsee and Langer See, the second by a portion of the Berliner Stadtforst. The zone of Schmöckwitzwerder is crossed by the Oder-Spree Canal. Some islets belong to the locality: Klein Rohrwall is on Langer See, Werderchen, Weidenwall (both in front of the village), Seddinwall, Klein Seddinwall, Nixenwall, Dommelwall and Berg on Seddinsee, Zeuthener Wall on Zeuthener See."
